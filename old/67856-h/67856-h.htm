</div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE baby was born at Whitewater Farms about nine
in the morning, April 19, 1900. Two pure-breed
calves,&mdash;one a heifer, the other a bull,&mdash;were dropped the
same day at nearly the same hour.</p>

<p>Odell came in toward noon, heard these farm items from
his foreman, Ed Lister.</p>

<p>For twenty years Odell&#8217;s marriage had been childless.
He had waited in vain for a son,&mdash;for several sons,&mdash;and
now, after twenty sterile years of hardship, drudgery, and
domestic discord, Fanny had given him a girl.</p>

<p>He stood in silence, chewing the bitter news.</p>

<p>&#8220;Awright,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that&#8217;s <i>that</i>! Is Queen doin&#8217; good?&#8221;</p>

<p>Whitewater Queen was doing as well as could be expected
and her fourth heifer-calf was a miracle of Guernsey
beauty.</p>

<p>&#8220;Awright! Veal that danged bull-caaf. That&#8217;s White
Chief&#8217;s second bull outa White Rose. I&#8217;m done. We&#8217;ll
take her to Hilltop Acres next time. And that&#8217;s that!&#8221;</p>

<p>He dusted the fertiliser and land plaster from his patched
canvas jacket:</p>

<p>&#8220;It blowed some,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I oughta waited. Cost me
five dollars, mebbe. I thought it might rain; that&#8217;s why.
It&#8217;s one dum thing after another. It allus comes like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>He scraped the bottom of his crusted boots against the
concrete rim of the manure pit.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>A bitter winter with practically no snow; dry swamps;
an April drouth; a disastrous run of bull-calves with no
market,&mdash;and now, after twenty years, a girl baby!</p>

<p>How was a man going to get ahead? How was he to
break even? Twenty years Odell had waited for sons to
help him. He should have had three or four at work by
this time. Instead he was paying wages.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess Fanny&#8217;s kinda bad,&#8221; remarked the foreman.</p>

<p>Odell looked up from his brooding study of the manure.</p>

<p>&#8220;I dunno,&#8221; continued the foreman; &#8220;another Doc is here,
too. He come with a train nurse n&#8217;hour ago. Looks kinda
bad to me, Elmer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Odell gazed stupidly at Lister.</p>

<p>&#8220;What other Doc?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Old Doc Benson. Doc Wand sent Mazie for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Odell said nothing. After a moment or two he walked
slowly toward the house.</p>

<p>In the kitchen a neighbour, one Susan Hagan, a gross
widow, was waddling around getting dinner, perspiring and
garrulous. Two or three farm hands, in bantering conversation,
stood washing or drying their faces at the sink.</p>

<p>Mazie, the big, buxom daughter of Ed Lister, moved
leisurely about, setting the table. She was laughing, as
usual, at the men&#8217;s repartee.</p>

<p>But when Odell appeared the clatter of the roller-towel
ceased. So did Mazie&#8217;s laughter and the hired men&#8217;s banter.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hagan was the first to recover her tongue:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Elmer,&#8221; she began in unctuous tones, &#8220;you set
right down here and eat a mite o&#8217; ham&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; She already
had him by the sleeve of his canvas jacket. She grasped a
smoking fry-pan in the other hand. The smoke from it
blew into Odell&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Leggo,&#8221; he grunted, jerking his arm free.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hagan encountered Mazie&#8217;s slanting black eyes, narrow
with derision:</p>

<p>&#8220;Elmer don&#8217;t want to eat; he wants to see Fanny,&#8221; said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
Mazie Lister. And added: &#8220;Your ham&#8217;s burning, Mrs.
Hagan.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Doc Wand?&#8221; demanded Odell heavily.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hagan savagely snatched the answer from Mazie&#8217;s
red lips:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Elmer,&#8221; she burst out, &#8220;he&#8217;s went and called in old
Doc Benson; and Benson he fetched a train nurse from
Summit&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Smoke from the burning ham strangled her.
Odell left her coughing, and strode toward the sitting room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dang it!&#8221; he muttered, &#8220;what next!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was cool and dusky in the sitting room. He halted in
the golden gloom, sullenly apprehensive, listening for any
sound from the bed-room overhead.</p>

<p>After a little while Dr. Wand came downstairs. He was
haggard and white, but when he caught sight of Odell he
went to him with a smile. The village folk feared and
trusted Dr. Wand. They feared his sarcasm and trusted his
skill. But, with the self-assertion of inferiority, they all
called him &#8220;Fred&#8221; or &#8220;Doc.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Elmer,&#8221; he said, &#8220;the baby&#8217;s doing nicely.... I
thought I&#8217;d like to have Dr. Benson look at Fanny....
A fine baby, Elmer.... Fanny asked me to think up some
uncommon and pretty name for your little girl&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Name her anything,&#8221; said Odell thickly.... &#8220;Dang it,
I waited twenty years for a boy. And now look what I
get! It all comes to once. White Rose drops me a bull-caaf,
too. But I can veal <i>that</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Better luck next time&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he interrupted fiercely, &#8220;I&#8217;m done!&#8221; He turned
and stared at the sun-bars on the lowered shade, his tanned
features working.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like the herd,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Either the cow or the herd-bull&#8217;s
to blame for every dinged bull-caaf. And I can&#8217;t
afford to breed &#8217;em together more&#8217;n twice.... Twenty
years I been lookin&#8217; for a boy, Doc. No, I&#8217;m done. And
that&#8217;s that!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>&#8220;You&#8217;d better go and eat,&#8221; suggested the doctor.</p>

<p>Odell nodded: &#8220;Fanny awright?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re watching her. Perhaps you&#8217;d better stay around
this afternoon, Elmer&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I gotta spread manure&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want you within calling distance,&#8221; repeated the doctor
mildly.</p>

<p>Odell looked up. After a moment&#8217;s hesitation:</p>

<p>&#8220;Awright, Doc. I guess I can work around nearby.
You must be dead-beat. Eat a snack with us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not now. I can&#8217;t leave your wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean that Fanny&#8217;s kinda bad?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.... Your wife is very, very ill, Elmer. Dr. Benson
is with her now.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Breaking ground for a new kitchen garden that afternoon,
Odell found the soil so infested with quack-root,
horse-radish, and parsnip that he gave it up and told Lister
that they&#8217;d fence the place as cheaply as possible and turn
the hogs on it.</p>

<p>Lister hooked up a horse and drove away to hunt for
locust posts and wire. Odell dragged his plow to the wagon
shed, stabled the fat gray horse, walked slowly back toward
the wood shed. There was a dead apple tree he could fell
while waiting.</p>

<p>It was very still there in the April sunshine. All signs of
rain were gone. The wind had died out. Save for the
hum of bees in crocus and snow-drop, and except for the
white cock&#8217;s clarion from the runs, no sound broke the blue
silence of an April afternoon.</p>

<p>Odell looked up at the window of his wife&#8217;s bed-room.
The white-capped nurse was seated there, her head turned
as though intent upon something taking place within the
room. She did not stir. After a while Odell picked up
his spading fork and wiped the tines.</p>

<p>Yes, every kind of bad luck was coming at once; drouth,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
bull-calves, wind to waste fertiliser, doctors&#8217; bills, expenses
for a nurse, for Mrs. Hagan, for posts and wire,&mdash;and the
land riddled with quack and horse-radish....</p>

<p>He&#8217;d about broken even, so far, during the last twenty
years. All these years he&#8217;d marked time, doggedly, plugging
away. Because, after all, there had been nothing else
to do. He could not stop. To sell meant merely to begin
again somewhere else, plug away, break about even year
after year, die plugging. That was what general farming
meant in White Hills when there were wages to pay. He
could have made money with sons to help him.... Life
was a tread-mill. What his cattle took from the land they
gave back; nothing more. He was tired of the tread-mill.
A squirrel in a cage travelled no further and got as far....</p>

<p>Odell drove his spading fork into the ground, sifted out
fragments of horse-radish roots, kicked them under the
fence into the dusty road beyond.</p>

<p>Dr. Wand&#8217;s roadster stood out there by the front gate.
Behind it waited Dr. Benson&#8217;s driver in the new limousine
car. Odell had not felt he could afford any kind of car,&mdash;not
even a tractor. These danged doctors....</p>

<p>As he stood with one foot resting on his spading fork,
gazing gloomily at the two cars, Dr. Benson, fat, ruddy and
seventy, came out of the house with his satchel.</p>

<p>He nodded to Odell:</p>

<p>&#8220;Dr. Wand wants you,&#8221; he said. &#8220;She&#8217;s conscious.&#8221;</p>

<p>After the portly physician had driven away down the
dusty road, Odell went into the house and ascended the
stairs to the common bed-room from which now, in all
probability, he was to be excluded for a while.</p>

<p>Dr. Wand, beside the bed, very tired, motioned Odell to
draw nearer. It was the ghost of his wife he saw lying
there.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he grunted with an effort, &#8220;you don&#8217;t feel very
spry, I guess. You look kinda peekid, Fan.&#8221;</p>

<p>All the stored resentment of twenty barren years glittered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
in his wife&#8217;s sunken eyes. She knew his desire for sons.
She knew what he now thought of her.</p>

<p>She said in a distinct voice to Dr. Wand: &#8220;Tell him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The doctor said: &#8220;Your wife has asked me to think up
some new and unusual name for the baby. I suggested
&#8216;Eris,&#8217;&#8221; he added blandly. And, after a silence: &#8220;Your
wife seems to like the name.&#8221;</p>

<p>Odell nodded: &#8220;Awright.&#8221;</p>

<p>His wife said to the doctor, in her painfully distinct
voice: &#8220;I want she should have a name that no other baby&#8217;s
got.... Because&mdash;that&#8217;s all I can give her.... Something
no other baby&#8217;s got.... Write it, Doctor.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dr. Ward wrote &#8220;Eris&#8221; on the birth certificate. His
expression became slightly ironical.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eris,&#8221; he repeated. &#8220;Do you both approve this name?&#8221;</p>

<p>Odell shrugged assent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the woman. &#8220;She&#8217;s mine. All I can give
her is this name. <i>I</i> give it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eris was the name of a Greek goddess,&#8221; remarked the
doctor. He did not explain that Eris was the goddess of
Discord. &#8220;I&#8217;m very sure,&#8221; he added, &#8220;that no other baby is
named Eris.... But plenty of &#8217;em ought to be.... Was
there anything you wanted to say to your wife, Elmer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey?&#8221; demanded Odell, stupidly.</p>

<p>Suddenly something in the physician&#8217;s eyes sent a dull
shock through Odell. He turned and stared at his wife as
though he had never before laid eyes on her. After a
while he found his voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;You&mdash;you&#8217;ll get better after a spell,&#8221; he stammered.
&#8220;Feel like eatin&#8217; a mite o&#8217; sunthin&#8217; tasty? You want I
should get you a little jell &#8217;rsunthin&#8217;&mdash;Fanny&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Her bright, sunken gaze checked him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You ain&#8217;t asked to see the baby,&#8221; she said in her thin,
measured voice; &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry I ever bore a child to you,
Elmer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Odell reddened: &#8220;Where is it&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221; He stumbled up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
from his chair, looking vaguely about him, confused by her
brilliant eyes&mdash;by their measureless resentment.</p>

<p>For life was becoming too brief for pretence now. Fanny
knew it; her husband began to realise it.</p>

<p>She said: &#8220;I&#8217;m <i>glad</i> I have no sons. I&#8217;m sorry I bore a
child.... God forgive me.... Because I&#8217;ll never rest,
never be quiet, now.... But I don&#8217;t mind so much ...
if THEY will let me keep an eye on her somehow&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
She tried to lift her head from the pillow: &#8220;I want to see
her,&#8221; she said sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the doctor. &#8220;I want you to see her. Wait a
moment&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>As he passed Odell he drew him outside. &#8220;Go downstairs,&#8221;
he whispered. &#8220;I&#8217;ll call you if she asks to see you
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She ain&#8217;t a-goin&#8217; to get no better?&#8221; demanded Odell
hoarsely.</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>The physician passed on into the adjoining room, where
the nurse sat watching a new-born baby in its brand new
cradle.</p>

<p>Odell continued down the stairs, and seated himself in
the dim sitting room....</p>

<p>Everything was coming at once&mdash;drouth, wind, bull-calves,
girl babies&mdash;and Death.... All were coming at
once.... But no sons had ever come. None would ever
come now. So&mdash;wages must go on.... A woman to
mind the baby.... And somebody to keep house for him....
Expense piling on expense. And no outlook&mdash;no
longer any chance to break even.... Where was he to get
more money? He could not carry the farm on his own
shoulders all alone. The more work planned, the more men
needed; and the more it all cost. Increased acreage, redoubled
production, got him no further. Always it was, at
best, merely an even break&mdash;every loss offsetting every
gain....</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>One of the cats came in with a barn rat hanging from her
mouth, looked furtively at Odell, then slunk out, tail
twitching.</p>

<p>The man dropped his elbows on the centre table and took
his unshaven face between both scarred fists....</p>

<p>The room had grown as still as death now. Which was
fitting and proper.</p>

<p>After a long while Dr. Wand descended the stairs. Odell
stood up in the semi-dusk of the sitting room.</p>

<p>&#8220;She didn&#8217;t ask for you again,&#8221; said the doctor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is&mdash;is she&mdash;gone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.... Quite painlessly.&#8221;</p>

<p>They walked slowly to the porch. It was nearly milking
time. The herd was coming up the long lane,&mdash;the sun
dipping low behind,&mdash;and a delicate rosy light over everything.</p>

<p>&#8220;You got your milking to do,&#8221; said the doctor. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
notify Wilbur Chase. I&#8217;ll see to everything, Elmer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wilbur Chase was the local undertaker. The doctor went
out to the road, cranked his car, got in wearily, and rolled
away toward the village.</p>

<p>Odell stood motionless. In his ears sounded the cow-bells,
tonk-a-tonk, tonk-a-tonk, as the Whitewater herd
turned leisurely into the barn-yard. Ed Lister opened the
sliding doors to the cow-barn. A frisky heifer or two
balked; otherwise the herd went in soberly, filing away
behind spotless, sweet-smelling rows of stalls, greeted
thunderously by the great herd-bull from his steel bull-pen.</p>

<p>Odell, heavy-eyed, turned on his heel and went upstairs.</p>

<p>But at the door of the silent room above the nurse barred
his way.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll let you know when you can see her,&#8221; she said. &#8220;She
isn&#8217;t ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>Odell gazed at her in a bewildered way.</p>

<p>&#8220;The baby is in the other room,&#8221; added the nurse. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
wake her. Better not touch her.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>He went, obediently, stood in the doorway, his scarred
hands hanging.</p>

<p>Eris lay asleep in her brand new cradle, almost invisible
under the white fabrics that swathed her.</p>

<p>The chamber of death was no stiller than this dim room
where life was beginning. There was no sound, no light
except a long, rosy ray from the setting sun falling athwart
the cradle.</p>

<p>So slept Eris, daughter of discord, and so named,&mdash;an
unwelcome baby born late in her parents&#8217; lives, and opening
her blind, bluish eyes like an April wind-flower in a world
still numb from winter.</p>

<p>Odell stared at the mound of covers.</p>

<p>It would be a long while before this baby could be of any
use at Whitewater Farms.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">IT is a long lane that has no turning, either for cattle or
for men.</p>

<p>When Fanny died Odell was forty. Two months later
he married the strapping daughter of Ed Lister. And
came to the turn in the long, long lane he had travelled for
twenty years.</p>

<p>For, as Whitewater Queen was a breeder of heifer-calves,
Mazie Lister proved to be a breeder of men.</p>

<p>Every year, for the first four years, she gave Odell a son.</p>

<p>There was no fuss made about these events. Mazie
Lister was the kind of girl who could eat cabbage for breakfast,
wad it down with pie, drive it deeper with a quart of
buttermilk.</p>

<p>Once, to prove she could do it, she ate a whole roast
sucking pig, five boiled potatoes, six ears of corn, a dish of
cranberry sauce, and an entire apple pie; and washed it
down with three quarts of new cider.</p>

<p>Her feed never fattened her; it seemed to make her skin
pinker, teeth whiter, long, slanting black eyes more brilliant.</p>

<p>No cares worried her. She laughed a great deal. She
was busy from dawn to dark. Unfatigued but sleepy, she
yawned frightfully toward nine o&#8217;clock. It was her time
to roost.</p>

<p>Mazie&#8217;s instincts concerning progeny were simple. She
nursed each arrival as long as necessary, then weaned it.
Then the youngster had to learn to shift for himself&mdash;wash
and dress, turn up at meal hours, turn in with the
chickens, rise with the crows.</p>

<p>It was a little different, however, with Eris, whom Mazie<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
had inherited. Eris, of course, was bottle-fed. Whitewater
Queen&#8217;s heifer-calf, White Princess, had no better
care. Whatever was advisable was completely and thoroughly
done in both cases.</p>

<p>White Princess grew to beautiful Guernsey symmetry,
with every promise of conformation to classic type; and
was duly registered. Little Eris, small boned, with delicately
fashioned limbs, looked out on the world from a pair
of crystal-blue, baby eyes, which ultimately became a deep,
limpid grey.</p>

<p>Unlike White Princess, Eris did not promise to conform
to the Odell type. There seemed to be little of that breed
about her. Fanny had been bony and shiny-skinned, with
a high-bridged, pinkish nose, watery eyes&mdash;a wisp of a
woman with a rodent&#8217;s teeth and every articulation apparent
as a ridge under a dry, tightly stretched epidermis.</p>

<p>Odell, with his even, white teeth, coarse, highly-coloured
skin and brown eyes, was a compact, stocky, heavy-handed,
broad-footed product of Scotch-Irish pioneer stock. But
Fanny&#8217;s grandmother, a Louisiana Creole, had run away
from school to go on the stage, and had married a handsome
but dissolute Southern planter who died of drink.</p>

<p>Sundays Fanny used to wear her grandmother&#8217;s portrait
painted in miniature on ivory, as a breast-pin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hand-painted,&#8221; she used to explain. And always
added: &#8220;Creoles are all white.&#8221; Which was true. But,
when quarrelling with his wife, Odell pretended to believe
otherwise.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Rummaging through Fanny&#8217;s effects a day or two after
her marriage, Mazie discovered a painted fan, a mother-of-pearl
card-case, and this breast-pin. She carried the miniature
to Odell.</p>

<p>&#8220;Looks like baby,&#8221; she explained, with her care-free
laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll be lucky if she favours that pitcher,&#8221; said Odell.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
&#8220;But like as not she&#8217;ll take after Fanny.&#8221; He was wrong
in his guess.</p>

<p>When Eris was five her resemblance to the miniature had
become marked. And Mazie&#8217;s boys looked like their mother
and father.</p>

<p>On Saturday nights, after immersing her own unwilling
brunette brats in the weekly bath, Mazie found the slim
white body of little Eris an ever-increasing amusement and
a pique to her curiosity. The child&#8217;s frail yet healthy symmetry,
the fine skin, delicate, perfect limbs, lovely little
hands and feet, remained perennial sources of mirth and
surprise to this robust young woman who was equally
healthy, but built on a big, colourful, vigorous plan.</p>

<p>Solid and large of limb and haunch, deep-bosomed,
ruddy-skinned, the young stepmother always bred true to
type. Her sons were sons of the soil from birth. There
could be no doubt about her offspring. What wasn&#8217;t Lister
was Odell. They belonged to the land.</p>

<p>But when Mazie looked at her husband and looked at the
child, Eris&mdash;and when she remembered Fanny&mdash;then she
wondered and was inclined to smile. And she was content
that her sons&#8217; thick, sturdy bodies and slanting, black eyes
so plainly advertised the stock they came from. Utility.
Health. Strength.</p>

<p>Fanny had had a pink nose. Even a Guernsey ought to
have one. But the nose of Eris was snow white. To
what stock did this child throw back?</p>

<p>When Eris was seven she was sent to the village school,
leading her eldest stepbrother thither by the hand. Both
were scared and tearful. Nobody went with little Eris to
mitigate the ordeal; and she was a most sensitive child.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Hers had been a deathless curiosity since she was old
enough to ask her first question. An unquenchable desire
for information seemed to possess her. Her eternal, &#8220;Will
you tell me why?&#8221; became a nuisance.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>&#8220;Dang it, send her to school!&#8221; shouted Odell at last.
And that was how.</p>

<p>At her small desk, rigid, bewildered, terribly intent on
the first teacher in human form she had ever gazed upon,
she found herself on the verge of tears. But, before she
could dissolve, her brother forestalled her, bursting into
vigorous yells, bawling like a calf; and would not be comforted.
Which allowed Eris no time for private grief
while wiping his eyes with her pinafore.</p>

<p>Noonday recess and lunch baskets and the wildly gyrating
horde of children let loose on a sandy playground ended the
first encounter between Eris Odell and the great god Education
in His Local Temple at White Hills Village.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Eris learned little in school. There is little to learn in
American schools. No nation is more illiterate. And in
the sort of school she went to the ignorant are taught by the
half educated.</p>

<p>None of her teachers could speak English as it should be
spoken. In their limited vocabulary there was no room for
choice of words. Perhaps that was why negatives were
doubled now and then.</p>

<p>As for the rest, she was stuffed with falsified history and
unessential geographical items; she was taught to read after
a fashion, and to spell, and to juggle figures. There was a
nature class, too, full of misinformation. And once an
owlish, elderly man lectured on physiology; and told them
in a low and solemn voice that &#8220;there is two sects in the
phenonemy of natur, and little boys are made diffrunt to
little girls.&#8221;</p>

<p>That ended the lecture, leaving every little boy and little
girl mad with unsatisfied curiosity, and some of the older
children slightly uncomfortable.</p>

<p>But The Great American Ass dominates this splendid
land of ours. He <i>knows</i>. He&#8217;ll tell the world. And
that&#8217;s that&mdash;as Odell was accustomed to say. And early in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
her career little Eris caught the cant phrase of finality from
her father, and incorporated it with her increasing lingual
equipment.</p>

<p>When one of the boys tried to kiss her, she kicked his
shins. &#8220;And that&#8217;s <i>that</i>!&#8221; she added breathlessly, smoothing
out her rumpled pinafore.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In Mazie she had a stepmother who made no difference
between Eris and her own progeny. She kissed them all
alike at bedtime; dosed them when necessary, comforted
their sorrows with stock reassurances from a limited vocabulary,
darned, sewed, mended, washed for all alike.</p>

<p>Mazie gave her children and her husband all she had time
to give&mdash;all she had the capacity to give&mdash;the kindly, cheerful
offices and understanding of a healthy female.</p>

<p>Whitewater Queen was as good a mother. Both lacked
imagination. But Whitewater Queen didn&#8217;t need any.</p>

<p>For a time, however, the knowledge imbibed at school
nourished Eris, although there were few vitamines in the
feed.</p>

<p>When she was thirteen her brothers&mdash;twelve, eleven, ten
and nine&mdash;alternately bullied her, deferred to her, or ran
bawling to her with their troubles.</p>

<p>When she was fourteen the world met its own weird at
Armageddon. The old order of things began to change.
A new earth and a newly interpreted Heaven replaced the
&#8220;former things&#8221; which had &#8220;passed away.&#8221;</p>

<p>At eighteen Eris looked out over the smoking d&eacute;bris of
&#8220;former things&#8221;&mdash;gazed out of limpid grey eyes upon &#8220;a
new Heaven and a new Earth&#8221;; and saw the cloudy, gigantic
spectre of all-that-had-once-been receding, dissolving,
vanishing from the world where it had reigned so tyrannically
and so long.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>About that time she dreamed, for the first time, that
dream which so often re-occurred in after years&mdash;that she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
stood at her open window, naked, winged, restless for flight
to some tremendous height where dwelt the aged god of
Wisdom all alone, cutting open a human heart that was
still faintly pulsating.</p>

<p>At eighteen&mdash;the year the world war was ended&mdash;Eris
&#8220;graduated.&#8221;</p>

<p>She wrote a little act for herself, designed her own costume,
made it, acted, sang, and danced the part. It was
the story of a poor girl who prays for two things&mdash;a pair of
wings so that she may fly to the moon, and a new hat for the
journey. Suddenly she discovers a new hat in her hands.
The next instant two beautiful little wings sprout on her
shoulders. Instantly she takes scissors and snips off the
wings and trims her new hat with them. Ready for her
journey, suddenly she realises that now she cannot fly.
She tears the wings from the hat. Too late. She can&#8217;t
fasten them to her shoulders again. They flutter to her
feet. She falls on her knees in a passion of tears. The
moon rises, grinning.</p>

<p>It was a vast success&mdash;this little act of Eris Odell&mdash;and
while its subtler intent was quite lost on the honest folk of
White Hills Village, the story itself was so obvious and
Eris did it so prettily that even her father grunted approval.</p>

<p>That evening he promised her the next heifer-calf for
her own. If it proved a good one the sale of it should provide
a nice nest-egg for Eris when she married.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The next heifer-calf promised well. Eris named her
White Iris and she was so registered.</p>

<p>In the yearling pure-breeds she was first at the Comity
Fair. But Eris refused to sell. At the State Fair White
Iris beat every Guernsey and every other heifer, pure-breed
and grade.</p>

<p>Brookvale Manor offered her three thousand dollars.
Odell made her take it, and put the money into the local
bank. So, with tears blinding her grey eyes, Eris sold<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
White Iris out of the county. And would not be comforted
even by the brand new cheque-book sent to her by
the cashier of the White Hills Bank.</p>

<p>The account, however, was in her father&#8217;s name.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Now, the horizon of Eris Odell had narrowed as her
sphere of activity dwindled after graduation.</p>

<p>Whitewater Farms became her world. Within its confines
lay her duties and diversions, both clearly defined.</p>

<p>They were her heritage. No loop-holes offered escape&mdash;excepting
marriage. And that way out was merely the way
in to another and similar prison the boundary of which was
a barbed wire fence, and its mathematical centre a manure
pit.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>She continued to dream of wings. An immense, indefinable
longing possessed her in waking hours. But she
was only one of the youthful, excited millions, waking after
&aelig;ons to the first instincts that had ruled the human
race.</p>

<p>It was the restlessness of the world&#8217;s youth that stirred
her&mdash;Modern Youth opening millions of clear young eyes to
gaze upon the wonders of a new Heaven and a new earth,
and mad to explore it all from zenith to depths&mdash;sky, sea,
land, and the waters under the earth. Youth, suddenly
crazed by an overwhelming desire for Truth, after &aelig;ons
and &aelig;ons of lies.</p>

<p>Explore, venture, achieve, live&mdash;demand Truth, exact it,
face it, and <i>know</i>!&mdash;the mighty, voiceless cry of the World&#8217;s
Youth&mdash;claiming freedom to seek, liberty to live, fearless,
untrammelled, triumphant. A terrible indictment of Age,
and of those age-governed &aelig;ons which forever have passed
away.</p>

<p>Already the older, duller generation caught the vast vibration
of young hearts beating to arms, young voices swelling
the tremulous, universal cry of insurgence, a clear, ceaseless,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
sea-like sound of laughter proclaiming the death of Sham&mdash;ringing
an endless, silvery requiem.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Odell shoved up his spectacles and lowered the newspaper
to glance at Eris.</p>

<p>&#8220;What say?&#8221; he repeated fretfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to study dancing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you dance? You go to enough socials and showers
&#8217;n&#8217;one thing &#8217;n&#8217;other.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean&mdash;stage dancing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stage!&#8221; he thundered. &#8220;Be you crazy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Eris, how you talk!&#8221; said her stepmother, too
astounded to laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;I could go to New York and work in a store by day;
and take stage-dancing lessons evenings,&#8221; murmured the
girl. &#8220;I want to be somebody.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You stay here and do your chores and try to act as if
you ain&#8217;t a little loonatic!&#8221; shouted Odell. &#8220;I&#8217;m sicka
hearing about the capers and kickups of young folks nowaday.
Them gallivantins don&#8217;t go in my house. I&#8217;m sicka
reading about &#8217;em, too. And that&#8217;s <i>that</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;After all,&#8221; said Eris, &#8220;why do I have to do what I don&#8217;t
care to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dang it,&#8221; retorted her father, &#8220;didn&#8217;t you never hear of
dooty? What d&#8217;they teach you in school?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing much,&#8221; she replied listlessly. &#8220;Did you always
want to be a farmer, daddy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you a farmer because you wanted to be? Or did
you want to be something else?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What dinged trash you talk,&#8221; he said, disgusted. &#8220;I
didn&#8217;t wanta be a blacksmith or I&#8217;da been one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why can&#8217;t <i>I</i> be what I&#8217;d like to be? Will you tell me
why?&#8221;</p>

<p>Odell, speechless, resumed his newspaper. It was nearly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
nine o&#8217;clock and he hadn&#8217;t read half the local news and none
of the column devoted to the Grange.</p>

<p>Eris looked wistfully at him, loitering still in the doorway,
slim, grey-eyed, undeveloped.</p>

<p>Her stepmother laughed at her: &#8220;Notions,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know you&#8217;d go to rack and rooin that way?
You go to bed, Eris.... There&#8217;s fresh ginger snaps in the
pantry.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">UNTIL the Great War turned the world upside down,
Whitewater Farms made money after Odell married
Ed Lister&#8217;s daughter.</p>

<p>Shortage of labour during the war cut into profits; taxes
wiped them out; the ugly, Bolshevik attitude of labour
after the war caused a deficit.</p>

<p>It was the sullen inertia of the mob, conscious of power.
Men did not care whether they worked at all. If they
chose to work, mills and factories would pay them enough
in three days to permit them to remain idle the remainder
of the week. No farmer could pay the swollen wages demanded
for field labour, and survive financially.</p>

<p>Every village was full of idle louts who sneered at offered
employment.</p>

<p>Fruit rotted in orchards, grain remained uncut, cattle
stood neglected. The great American loafer leered at the
situation. The very name of Labour stank. It stinks still.
The Great American Ass has made the term a stench in the
nostrils of civilisation.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The next year mills and factories began to lay off labour.
Odell and Lister scraped together a few sulky field hands,
mainly incompetents, men who had spent all their wages.
Fields were sullenly tilled, crops gathered, cattle cared for.</p>

<p>Except for profiteers, reaction had set in. War profligacy,
asinine finance, crushing taxes already were doing
their work.</p>

<p>Rather than pay for feed, farmers sold their stock. The
demand for pork started everybody hog-raising. Prices<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
fell; loss followed. Then stagnation. It was the bitter
aftermath of war&mdash;the deluge. Dead water.</p>

<p>Only one star of hope glimmered over the waste,&mdash;the
New Administration.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Spring was a month early that year. Odell, at sixty,
unimpaired by pie and the great American frying pan, his
gaitered legs planted sturdily in the new grass, looked out
over his domain and chewed a clover stem.</p>

<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t afraid,&#8221; he said to Lister. &#8220;I&#8217;m going the hull
hog. Every acre.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s your help?&#8221; remonstrated Lister.</p>

<p>&#8220;I got &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some on &#8217;em is quitters. They&#8217;ll lay down on yeh,
Elmer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Odell spat out the clover stem: &#8220;Every acre, Ed!&#8221; he
repeated. &#8220;And six cows on test.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We ain&#8217;t got the help&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Six cows,&#8221; growled Odell; &#8220;White Lady, Snow Queen,
Silver Maid, Thistledown, Milkweed Lass, and Whitewater
Lily.... I gotta make money. I&#8217;m aimin&#8217; to and I&#8217;m
a-going to. I got four sons. And that&#8217;s that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Elmer&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Awright. I know all what you gonna say, Ed. But
where does it get you to go around with a face a foot long?
How&#8217;s things to start unless somebody starts &#8217;em? Awright,
prices is bad. You can&#8217;t sell a pure-breed caaf in this
dinged country. There isn&#8217;t no market for a fancy heifer.
Everybody&#8217;s breedin&#8217; Holsteins &#8217;n&#8217;sloshin&#8217; around after
grades. Awright; nobody wants Guernsey quality; everybody
wants Holstein bulk &#8217;n&#8217;watery milk &#8217;n&#8217;everything. I
know. And my answer is, <i>every acre</i>, Ed; and six cows on
test; and higher prices on every danged caaf that&#8217;s dropped.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I sell a heifer it&#8217;s a favour to be paid for through the
nose. And I feed every bull-caaf and no vealin&#8217; this year.
Enough hogs to turn out till October; not another danged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
snout! If the Bank don&#8217;t see me through I&#8217;ll blow it up.
Now, g&#8217;wan and make your plans.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went into the creamery where his wife stood beside
the separator, watching a cat lap up some spilled cream.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your pa&#8217;s timid, Mazie,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I tell him I cal&#8217;late
t&#8217;start under full steam. What do you say?&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed: &#8220;Pa&#8217;s got notions. He allus was a mite
slow. I guess you know best, Elmer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We all gotta work,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That means Eris, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She allus helps me,&#8221; remarked Mazie, simply.</p>

<p>&#8220;I dunno what she does,&#8221; grunted Odell; &#8220;&mdash;sets a hen
or two, fools around the incubators, digs up a spoonful of
scratch-feed&mdash;what does she do, anyhow?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The child mends and irons&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When she ain&#8217;t readin&#8217; or tendin&#8217; her flowers or moonin&#8217;
&#8217;round the woods &#8217;n&#8217;fields,&#8221; retorted Odell. &#8220;Eris reckons
she&#8217;s too fine a lady for farm folk, I guess. I want her to
keep busy. And that&#8217;s that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Somebody&#8217;s got to tend the flowers,&#8221; remonstrated
Mazie. &#8220;You don&#8217;t want we should have no posy bed,
Elmer&mdash;like poor folks down to the Holler, do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can git along &#8217;n&#8217;eat dinner without posies. Why don&#8217;t
Erie read the <i>Grange Journal</i>? Oh, no; it&#8217;s fancy novels
and highfalutin&#8217; books she studies onto. And she&#8217;s allus
cuttin&#8217; out these here fashions into these here magazines
with coloured pitchers outside. Did you ever see Eris
studyin&#8217; into a cook-book? Or a seed catalogue? Or the
<i>Guernsey Cattle Magazine</i>? Or the <i>Breeder&#8217;s Guide</i>&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You let her be,&#8221; said Mazie, good-naturedly. &#8220;The
housework&#8217;s done and that&#8217;s all you need to know. She can
cook and make a bed if she&#8217;s a mind to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mind,&#8221; growled Odell, &#8220;&mdash;what&#8217;s a girl want of a mind?
All she uses it for is to plan how to play-act on the stage or
gallivant into moving pitchers. All she thinks about is how
to git to New York to hunt up some fancy job so she can
paint her face and dance in bare legs&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>&#8220;Now, Elmer, Eris is too smart to act foolish; and she&#8217;s
educated real well. You liked to see her act in school, and
you thought she danced nicely. She&#8217;s only a child yet&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s twenty!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s no more&#8217;n sixteen in her way of thinking, Elmer.
She&#8217;s a good girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t say she&#8217;s bad. But she&#8217;s twenty, and she ought
to be more help to us. And she ought to quit readin&#8217; and
moonin&#8217; and dreamin&#8217; and lazin&#8217;&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You quit <i>your</i> lazin&#8217;, too,&#8221; laughed Mazie, setting a pan
of cream in the ice chest. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you go down to the
barn and ring that new herd-bull? You can&#8217;t get him into
the paddock without a staff any more. And if you don&#8217;t
watch out Whitewater Chieftain will hurt somebody....
&#8217;N&#8217;I&#8217;ll be a widow.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Odell went out the dairy door, preoccupied with the
ticklish job before him, he met Eris with her arms full of
new kittens.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mitzi&#8217;s,&#8221; she explained, &#8220;aren&#8217;t they too cunning,
daddy? I hope they&#8217;re not to be drowned.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t runnin&#8217; a cat-farm,&#8221; remarked Odell. &#8220;Did you
mend my canvas jacket?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; it&#8217;s on your bed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you coop them broody hens? I bet you didn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. There are seventeen in three coops.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Housework done?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Awright. Why don&#8217;t you get the cook-book and set in
the hammock a spell?&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl laughed: &#8220;Don&#8217;t you like mother&#8217;s cooking?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;S&#8217;all right for <i>me</i>. But I don&#8217;t cal&#8217;late your mother&#8217;s
going to cook for the fella you hitch up with.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eris turned up her nose: &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry. I shan&#8217;t ever
marry. Not any boy in <i>this</i> town, anyway. Probably I&#8217;ll
never marry.... I&#8217;ll not have time,&#8221; she added, half to
herself.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>Odell, who was going, stopped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;An actress ought not to marry. She ought to give every
moment to her art,&#8221; explained the girl na&iuml;vely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is&mdash;that&mdash;so? Well, you can chase that idea outa your
head, my girl, because you ain&#8217;t never going to be no actress.
And that&#8217;s <i>that</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some day,&#8221; said Eris, with a flushed smile, &#8220;I shall
follow my own judgment and give myself to art.... And
that&#8217;s <i>that</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>As they stood there, father and daughter, confronting
each other in the pale April sunshine, the great herd-bull
bellowed from the cattle-barn, shaking the still air with his
thunderous reverberations. He was to be shot that evening.</p>

<p>Eris sighed: &#8220;He misses his companions,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;and he tells us so.... Poor White Lightning.... And
I, also, miss the companionship of all I have never known....
Some day I shall tell you so.... I hope you&#8217;ll understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You talk like a piece in a magazine,&#8221; said Odell; &#8220;you
better quit reading them danged love stories and movin&#8217;
pitcher magazines and study into the <i>Farm Journal</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d be very proud of me if I became a great actress,&#8221;
she said seriously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d be a danged sight prouder if you was a great cook,&#8221;
he grunted. And he went toward the cattle-barn, spinning
the patent self-piercing nose ring on his horny forefinger.</p>

<p>Eris called after him: &#8220;Have you <i>got</i> to shoot Lightning?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I gotta beef him. He&#8217;s no good any more.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>So the great herd-bull, like all &#8220;Former Things,&#8221; was
doomed to &#8220;pass away.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the Dionysia became the Mithraic Rites, so was
taurian glory doomed to pass.... A bullet where Aldebaran
shows the way. The way of all bulls.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>Neither Odell nor Eris had ever heard of Aldebaran.
And the tombs of the Magi were no more tightly sealed than
the mind of the father. But the child&#8217;s mind hid a little
lamp unlighted. A whisper might reveal to her Aldebaran
shining in the midnight heavens. Or the Keys of Life and
Death hanging on the Rosy Cross....</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The bull died at the appointed hour. Eris stood in her
bed-room closing both ears with trembling palms.</p>

<p>She did not hear the shot. Mazie found her there;
laughed at her good-naturedly.</p>

<p>Eris&#8217; lips formed the words: &#8220;Is he dead?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear, he&#8217;s Polack beef by now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gloria tauri&mdash;gloria mundi. But whatever ends always
begins again.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>What was the Dionysia is now Rosicrucian ... and
shall again be something else ... and always the same.</p>

<p>As for the Bull of Mithra&mdash;and Mithra, too&mdash;bull-calves
are born every day. And there are a million million suns in
the making.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s only the Old Order that changes, not what orders it.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">BULLS die; men die; the old order dies,&mdash;slowly
sometimes, sometimes in the twinkling of an eye.</p>

<p>The change came swiftly upon Eris; passed more swiftly
still, leaving no outward trace visible. But when it had
passed, the heart and mind of Eris were altered. All
doubt, all hesitation fled. She understood that now the
road to the stars was open, and that, one day, she would do
what she had been born to do.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The World War was partly responsible for the affair.
The dye situation in the United States resulted. In Whitewater
Mills, both dyes and mordants remained unsatisfactory.
The mill chemist could do nothing and they let
him go.</p>

<p>Where cotton was used in shoddy combination with
wool, permanency of colour scarcely mattered&mdash;the poor
always getting the dirty end of everything in a nation that
has always laughed at a swindle.</p>

<p>But before the war, Whitewater Mills had built a separate
plant for fine hosiery, lisle and silk, and had specialised
in mauves and blues&mdash;fast, unfading, beautiful colours, the
secret of which remained in Germany.</p>

<p>Now, desiring to resume, and unable to import, the
directors of the mill sent a delegation to New York to find
out what could be done.</p>

<p>There the delegates discovered, dug out, and engaged a
chemist named E. Stuart Graydon.</p>

<p>It appeared that the secrets of German dyes and mordants
were known to Mr. Graydon. How they became known to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
him he explained very frankly and eloquently. Candour,
an engaging smile, pale smooth features full of pale bluish
shadows,&mdash;these and a trim figure neatly clothed made up
the ensemble of Mr. Graydon.</p>

<p>Permanent colour was his specialty. Anyway, his long,
steady fingers were permanently stained with acid and nicotine.
He was employed by a photographer when they discovered
him. Or, to be accurate, <i>he</i> discovered <i>them</i> at
their third-class hotel on Broadway.... And never left
them until he had signed a contract.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was after church that somebody introduced E. Stuart
Graydon to Eris.</p>

<p>He walked home with the family; and his talent for
general conversation earned him an invitation to remain to
midday dinner.</p>

<p>Quiet, convincing eloquence was his asset. There appeared
to be no subject with which he was not reasonably
familiar. His, also, was that terrible gift for familiarity
of every description; he became a friend over night, a member
of the family in a week. He was what Broadway calls
&#8220;quick study,&#8221; never risking &#8220;going stale&#8221; by &#8220;letter perfect&#8221;
preparation for an opening.</p>

<p>He took a deep interest in Guernsey breeding. But
Odell did the talking. That was how Graydon acquired a
reputation for an astonishing versatility;&mdash;he started the
subject and kept it kindled while others did the talking.
And in ten minutes he was able to converse upon the theme
with a skilful and convincing fluency entirely irresistible.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>After dinner Mazie showed him Fanny&#8217;s miniature on
ivory.</p>

<p>He smilingly sketched for the family a brief history of
miniature painting. It happened that he was minutely
familiar with all methods and all branches of Art. Indeed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
that was how the entire affair started. And Art accounted
for the acid stains, also.</p>

<p>To Eris, Art included the drama, and all that her ardent
mind desired. It took Mr. Graydon about five minutes to
discover this. And of course it transpired that he knew
everything connected with the drama, spoken and silent.</p>

<p>The next evening he came to supper. He talked cattle,
ensilage, rotation of crops, sub-soils, inoculation, fertilisers,
with Odell until the hypnotised farmer was loth to let
him go.</p>

<p>He talked to Mazie about household economy, labour-saving
devices, sanitary disposal plants, water systems,
bleaches&mdash;with which he was dreadfully familiar&mdash;furniture
polish, incubators.</p>

<p>With the boys he discussed guns and ammunition, traps
and trapping, commercial education, the relation of labour
to capital, baseball in the State League, ready-made clothing,
the respective merits of pointers, setters, bull terriers
and Airedales.</p>

<p>Hypnotised yawns protested against the bed hour in the
household of Odell. Nobody desired to retire. The spell
held like a trap.</p>

<p>As for Eris, she decided to stay in the sitting room with
Mr. Graydon when the family&#8217;s yawns at last started them
blinking bedward.</p>

<p>Odell, yawning frightfully, got into his night-shirt and
then into bed; and lay opening and shutting his eyes like an
owl on the pillow while Mazie, for the first time in months,
did her hair in curl papers.</p>

<p>&#8220;A nice, polite, steady young man,&#8221; she said, nodding at
Odell&#8217;s reflection in the looking glass. &#8220;My sakes alive,
Elmer, what an education he&#8217;s got!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stew Graydon knows a thing or two, I guess,&#8221; yawned
Odell. &#8220;You gotta be mighty spry to get a holt onto that
young fella.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;ve a notion they pay him a lot down to the mill,&#8221; suggested
Mazie.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t expec&#8217; to hire a Noo York man like that fer
nothin&#8217;,&#8221; agreed Odell. &#8220;He&#8217;s smart, he is. And there&#8217;s
allus a market fer real smartness. Like as not that young
fella will find himself a rich man in ten years. I guesso.&#8221;</p>

<p>A silence; Mazie busy with her lustrous hair,&mdash;the plump,
rosy, vigorous incarnation of matronly health.</p>

<p>In the mirror she caught Elmer&#8217;s sleepy eye and laughed,
displaying her white teeth.</p>

<p>&#8220;You think he kinda favours Eris?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know why else he come to supper.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He come to supper to talk farmin&#8217; with me,&#8221; said Odell
gruffly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe. Only I guess not,&#8221; laughed Mazie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, why did he come, then? He wanted I should
show him the new separator and them samples of cork-brick.
He&#8217;s a chemist, ain&#8217;t he? He&#8217;s int-rested in cork-brick
and separators &#8217;n&#8217; all like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mazie twisted a curl paper around a thick brown tress.</p>

<p>&#8220;When he talked about the theatre and acting,&#8221; she remarked,
&#8220;did you notice how Eris acted?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She gawked at him,&#8221; grunted Odell. &#8220;She&#8217;d better get
that pitcher idee outa her fool head,&mdash;lazin&#8217; around readin&#8217;
them pitcher magazines &#8217;n&#8217; novels, &#8217;n&#8217; moonin all over the
place instid of findin&#8217; chores to occupy her &#8217;n&#8217; doin&#8217;
them&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, hush,&#8221; interrupted Mazie; &#8220;you talk and take on
awful foolish, Elmer. When Eris marries some bright,
steady boy, all that trash in her head will go into the slop-pail.&#8221;</p>

<p>Odell scowled:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, why don&#8217;t she marry, then? She ain&#8217;t no help to
you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She <i>is</i>! Hush up your head. You&#8217;ll miss her, too,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
when she marries, and some strange man takes her away.
I guess I know who aims to do it, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, who aims to do it? Hey? She don&#8217;t have nothin&#8217;
to say to our Whitewater boys. She allus acts proud and
highmighty and uppish. Dan Burns he come sparkin&#8217; her
&#8217;n&#8217; she stayed in her room and wouldn&#8217;t even come down to
supper. &#8217;N&#8217; there was Clay Wallace, &#8217;n&#8217; Buddy Morgan&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks like she&#8217;s willing to be sparked to-night, don&#8217;t
it?&#8221; said Mazie, with an odd little laugh.</p>

<p>Elmer rose on one elbow: &#8220;Say, you don&#8217;t think <i>he</i>
wants our Eris, do yeh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not? Isn&#8217;t Eris good enough for any man?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, well, dang it all, Stew Graydon seems diff-runt....
He&#8217;s too educated &#8217;n&#8217; stylish for plain folks&mdash;&#8217;n&#8217; he&#8217;s
got a big position in the mill. He don&#8217;t want our Eris&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why <i>not</i>?&#8221; repeated Mazie.</p>

<p>Odell shook his frowsy head: &#8220;He&#8217;ll want a rich girl.
Eris hain&#8217;t got only that heifer-money. I can&#8217;t give her
more&#8217;n a mite&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That don&#8217;t count with me, Elmer.&#8221; She flushed, &#8220;&mdash;it
didn&#8217;t count with <i>you</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you was worth consid&#8217;ble more&#8217;n cash,&#8221; he
grunted.</p>

<p>&#8220;So&#8217;s any girl&mdash;if a boy likes her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You think a smart man like Stew Graydon&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do I know?&#8221; drawled Mazie. &#8220;She&#8217;s downstairs
yet with him, ain&#8217;t she? I never knew her to act that way
before. Nor you, either.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>She never had &#8220;acted that way before.&#8221;</p>

<p>The drowning swimmer and his straw&mdash;Eris and the
first man she ever had met who had been actually in touch
with the mystery of the moving pictures&mdash;that was the
situation.</p>

<p>For Graydon&#8217;s personality she had only the virginal interest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
which is reassured by a pleasant manner, a pleasing
voice, and the trim, neat inconspicuousness of face, figure,
and apparel which invites neither criticism nor particular
admiration,&mdash;nor alarm.</p>

<p>But for his education, his knowledge, his wisdom, his
fluency,&mdash;above all for his evident sympathy and ability to
understand her desire,&mdash;she had an excited and passionate
need.</p>

<p>As he talked, he looked her over, carefully, cautiously&mdash;preoccupied
with odd and curious ideas even while conversing
about other things.</p>

<p>That evening, when taking leave, he pressed her slender
fingers together, gently, not alarming her&mdash;scarcely even
awaking self-consciousness. He was always the artist,
first of all.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>After a month, even Elmer understood that Graydon was
&#8220;sparking&#8221; Eris.</p>

<p>And, from the time that Eris first was made to understand
that fact she lived in a continuous, confused dream,
through the unreality of which sometimes she was aware of
her own heart beating with excitement.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>He had said to her, one evening, after the family had
gone to bed, that the stage was her vocation and that God
himself must have ordained that she should, one day, triumph
there.</p>

<p>She listened as in a blessed trance. All around her the
night air grew heavy with the scent of honeysuckle. A
moon was shining. The whippoorwill&#8217;s breathless cry came
from the snake-fence hedge.</p>

<p>When he had had his mental will of her&mdash;excited her
almost to blissful tears, soothed her, led her on, deftly,
eloquently&mdash;he took her smooth hand of a child. All set
for the last act, he drew the girl against his shoulder, taking
plenty of time.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>Her head was still swimming with his eloquence. Hope
intoxicated her. His lips meant nothing on her cheek&mdash;but
her mind was all a-quiver&mdash;and it was her mind alone that
he had stimulated and excited to an ecstasy uncontrollable;
and which now responded and acquiesced.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&#8220;And after we marry I am to study for the stage?&#8221; she
repeated, tremulously, oblivious of his arm tightening
around her body.</p>

<p>It transpired, gently and eloquently, that it was for this
very reason he desired to marry her and give her what was
nearest her girl&#8217;s heart&mdash;what her girl&#8217;s mind most ardently
desired in all the world&mdash;her liberty to choose.</p>

<p>But he warned her to keep the secret from her family.
Trembling, enchanted, almost frightened by the approaching
splendour of consummation, she promised in tears.</p>

<p>Then the barrier burst under an overwhelming rush of
gratitude. She was his. She would surrender, now, to
this man who had suddenly appeared from nowhere;&mdash;an
emissary of God sent to understand, sympathise, guide her
to that destiny which, even he admitted, God had ordained
as hers.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Eris was married to E. Stuart Graydon in her twentieth
year at the parsonage of the Whitewater Church, at ten
o&#8217;clock in the morning. All Whitewater attended and
gorged. No rural precedent was neglected&mdash;neither jest
nor rice nor old shoes,&mdash;everything happened, from the
organ music and the unctuous patronage of &#8220;Rev.
Styles,&#8221; to the thick aroma of the &#8220;bounteous repast&#8221; at
Whitewater Farms, where neighbours came, stuffed themselves,
and went away boisterously all that rainy afternoon.</p>

<p>Bride and groom were to depart on the six o&#8217;clock train
for Niagara.</p>

<p>About five o&#8217;clock, the groom, chancing to glance out of
the window, saw two men,&mdash;strangers in Whitewater but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
perfectly well known to him,&mdash;walking up the path that led
to the front door.</p>

<p>For a second he sat motionless; the next, he turned and
looked into the grey eyes of his bride.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eris,&#8221; he said calmly, &#8220;if anybody asks for me say I&#8217;ve
run down to the mill and I&#8217;ll be back in fifteen minutes.&#8221;</p>

<p>She smiled vaguely as he rose and went out the back way
where the automobiles were parked.</p>

<p>A few minutes later Odell was called from the room by
one of his sons:</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, pop, there&#8217;s a party out here inquiring for someone
they call Eddie Graydon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Odell went out to the porch: &#8220;What name?&#8221; he demanded,
eyeing the two strangers and their dripping umbrellas.</p>

<p>&#8220;You Elmer Odell?&#8221; demanded the taller man.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what my ma christened me,&#8221; replied Odell,
jocosely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your daughter marrying a man who calls himself E.
Stuart Graydon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She ain&#8217;t marryin&#8217; him. She&#8217;s done it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He jest stepped out. Gone to the mill to fix up sunthin&#8217;
before leavin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>The taller man said to his companion: &#8220;Run down to
the mill, will you?&#8221; And, as the other turned and walked
rapidly away in the rain:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got a warrant for Eddie Graydon when he comes
back. That&#8217;s one of his names. Eddie Carter is the right
one. Sorry for you, Mr. Odell; sorrier for your daughter.&#8221;</p>

<p>Odell stared at him, the purple veins beginning to swell on
his temples.</p>

<p>&#8220;D-dang it!&#8221; he stammered,&mdash;&#8220;what&#8217;s all this dinged
junk about? Who be you?&#8221;</p>

<p>And, when the tall, quiet man had terribly convinced him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
Odell staggered, slightly, and wiped the sweat from his
temples.</p>

<p>&#8220;That lad has a record,&#8221; said the detective, in his low,
agreeable voice. &#8220;He&#8217;s a fine artist and a crackerjack
chemist. Maybe he don&#8217;t know anything about the new
tens and twenties. Maybe. Nor anything about the location
of the plates.... My God, Mr. Odell, we&#8217;ve <i>got</i> to
get those plates. Only Brockway could have equalled that
engraving. Yes, sir&mdash;only the old man.&#8221;</p>

<p>Odell scarcely heard him for the thunderous confusion in
his brain.</p>

<p>He sat down, heavily, staring at space under knitted
brows. Minute after minute passed. The distant laughter
and clamour of guests came fitfully from the great kitchen
beyond. It rained and rained on the veranda roof.</p>

<p>After a quarter of an hour the detective came in from the
porch.</p>

<p>&#8220;You got a telephone, Mr. Odell?&#8221;</p>

<p>The farmer nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to call up my mate at the mill&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; looking
around the sitting room and finally locating the instrument.
&#8220;What&#8217;s the mill number?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Seven.&#8221;</p>

<p>He gave the crank a turn; the metal bell jingled.</p>

<p>After a few moments he got his mate. He talked rapidly
in a low, clear voice. Odell heard without listening or
understanding. The detective hung up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that fellow&#8217;s gone. He won&#8217;t come
back here. He&#8217;s gone!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What say?&#8221; mumbled Odell, wiping away the sweat.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m telling you that Eddie Carter has beat us to it. He
didn&#8217;t go to the mill. He won&#8217;t come back here....
Who&#8217;s got a big yellow touring car&mdash;a Comet Six&mdash;in this
town?&#8221;</p>

<p>Odell put his scarred hands to his forehead: &#8220;Doc
Benson, I guess,&#8221; he said vaguely.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>&#8220;He here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess he&#8217;s in there eatin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, tell him his car went out of town twenty minutes
ago at sixty per,&#8221; said the detective briskly.... &#8220;So long.
I&#8217;m sorry.... Is there a garage in the village where they
have cars for hire?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At the hotel,&#8221; said the farmer.... &#8220;By God!...&#8221;
He got up as though dazed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mazie,&#8221; he called hoarsely. Nobody heard him in the
gay tumult. He stared after the detective, who was walking
swiftly down the path in the rain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jesus,&#8221; he whispered.... &#8220;He done us all....
&#8217;N&#8217; that&#8217;s that! Oh, God!&mdash;&#8217;n&#8217; that&#8217;s <i>that</i>!&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A nine days&#8217; scandal in the village&mdash;a year&#8217;s food for
gossip&mdash;and that was that, also.</p>

<p>Neither blame nor disgrace attached to anybody. Nobody
thought less of the Odells, nor did they of themselves.</p>

<p>The crash of her dream-house stunned Eris. She took it
very silently, with no outward emotion.</p>

<p>After a month the whole thing seemed, in fact, a dream&mdash;too
unreal to believe or to grieve over.</p>

<p>After three months Odell talked vaguely of getting a
di-vorce, &#8220;so&#8217;s she kin hook up to somebody respectable
when she&#8217;s a mind to.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Eris flashed fire for the first time:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll never marry again! Never! I never wanted to
anyway. This is enough! I&#8217;ll live and die as I am. And
there&#8217;ll be no more men in my life and no bother about
divorce, either. He&#8217;ll never come back. What do I care
whether I&#8217;m married or not! It doesn&#8217;t mean anything and
it never will. I&#8217;m through with marriage and with marrying
men! And that&#8217;s <i>that</i>!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">IT was Sunday; and it was in May. To Whitewater
Farms floated the sound of bells from three village
churches, pealing alternately. With a final three strokes
from each bell, Odell and Lister drove out of the horse-barn
in the family carry-all. In God&#8217;s honour, Odell wore a
celluloid collar. Lister&#8217;s reverence was expressed in a new
scarlet bandanna.</p>

<p>Mazie, big, symmetrical, handsome in her trim summer
clothes, appeared from the house, herding her loitering,
loutish offspring&mdash;Gene, 18; Si, 17; Willis, 16; Buddy, 15;
all habited in the dark, ready-made clothing and dark felt
hats of rural ceremony, the gloomy similarity relieved only
by ready-made satin neck-scarfs of different but primitive
hues.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Eris?&#8221; inquired Odell.</p>

<p>Mazie laughed: &#8220;She ain&#8217;t ready, what with her curling
and her manicure set&mdash;busy &#8217;s&#8217;a bee from fingers to toes&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eris!&#8221; shouted her father, looking up at the open window,
where dotted muslin curtains were blowing.</p>

<p>Eris peeped out, her chestnut hair dishevelled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t wait,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll walk.&#8221;</p>

<p>Odell gathered the reins: &#8220;G&#8217;lang!&#8221; he grunted.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>For twenty minutes or more there was no sound in the
House of Odell except the flutter of muslin curtains.</p>

<p>Under the window a lilac bush was vibrant with bumble-bees;
robins ran through the grass; blue-birds drifted along
the fence from post to post in soft, moth-like flight.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>It was quite a while after the kitchen clock struck that
light, hurried steps sounded on the stairs.</p>

<p>Eris stepped out on the porch, radiant and in her best.</p>

<p>At twenty she had the slender immaturity of a girl of
sixteen. Her slim figure made her seem taller than she was.</p>

<p>Her hat was one of those sagging straw affairs. It tied
under the chin with lilac ribbon. Her thin white gown had
lilac ribbons on it, too. So did her sun-shade.</p>

<p>She was very late. She walked to the gate, keeping to
the brick path on account of her white shoes and stockings.</p>

<p>Here she consulted her wrist-watch. There was no use
hurrying now. She glanced up and down the road&mdash;possibility
of a belated neighbour giving her a lift to the village.</p>

<p>No, it was too late to hurry. Almost too late to go at all.</p>

<p>She looked up at the gate lilacs, broke off a heavy, mauve
cluster, inhaled the fragrance.</p>

<p>For a little while, still, she lingered on the chance of a
passing vehicle. Finally she returned to her room, took a
book from her pillow, took &#8220;the key to the fields,&#8221; and
sauntered off through the hillside orchard, now a wilderness
of pink and white bloom.</p>

<p>Everywhere the azure wings of blue-birds; the peach-red
of a robin&#8217;s breast; the broad golden glint of a flicker
flashing through high white bloom.</p>

<p>The breeze which had fluttered her muslin curtains was
busy up here, too, blowing white butterflies out of their
courses and spreading silvery streaks across tall grasses.</p>

<p>On the hill-top she paused, looking out over the world of
May.</p>

<p>Below her lay Whitewater Farms, neat as a group of
newly-painted toys, house, barns with their hip-gables, silos,
poultry-runs, sheds, out-buildings, whitewashed fences.</p>

<p>A mile south, buried among elms and maples, lay White
Hills Village, the spires of its three churches piercing the
foliage.</p>

<p>All around, east, west, south, rose low hills, patched with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
woods, a barn or two in silhouette on some grassy ridge.
Ploughed fields, pastures, squares of vivid winter wheat
checkered the panorama, the tender green of hard-wood
groves alternating with the dark beauty of hemlock and
white pine.</p>

<p>Overhead a blue sky, quite cloudless; over all, May sunshine;
the young world melodious with the songs of birds.
And Eris, twenty, with the heart and experience of sixteen.</p>

<p>Sweet, thrilling came the meadow lark&#8217;s calling from the
crests of tall elms. It seemed to pierce her heart.</p>

<p>To the breezy stillness of the hill came faintly out of the
valley the distant barking of a dog, a cock-crow, answered,
answered again from some remoter farm.</p>

<p>Eris turned and looked into the north, where bluish hills
spread away into the unknown.</p>

<p>Below her were the Home Woods, where Whitewater
Brook ran over silver gravel, under mossy logs, pouring
into deep, spreading pools, gliding swiftly amid a camouflage
of ferns, gushing out over limestone beds to clatter
and sparkle and fling rainbow spray across every sunny
glade.</p>

<p>Eris looked down at the woods. To venture down there
was not very good for her low-heeled, white sport shoes....
Of course she could clean them after noon dinner and
they&#8217;d be dry in time for&mdash;anything.... But for
<i>what</i>?</p>

<p>She paused at the wood&#8217;s edge, her mind on her shoes.</p>

<p>&#8220;In time for what?&#8221; she repeated aloud.</p>

<p>She stood, abstracted, grey eyes brooding the question.</p>

<p>What was there to dress for&mdash;to clean her white shoes
for? Evening service. A slow stroll with some neighbour&#8217;s
daughter along the village street. Gossip with other
young people encountered in the lamp-lit dark. Banter
with boys&mdash;passing the usual group clustered on fence or
wall&mdash;jests born of rural wit, empty laughter, emptier
retort&mdash;the slow stroll homeward.... This was what she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
dressed for.... Or for a party ... where the deadly
familiarity of every face and voice had long since dulled her
interest.... Where there was never any mental outlook;
no aspiration, no stimulation&mdash;no response to her restless
curiosity&mdash;where nobody could tell her &#8220;why.&#8221;</p>

<p>Standing there on the wood&#8217;s edge, she wondered why
she was at pains to dress becomingly for the sake of such
things as these.</p>

<p>She wondered why she cared for her person so scrupulously
in a family where a bath a week was the rule&mdash;in a
community where the drug-store carried neither orange-stick
nor depilatory.</p>

<p>It is true, however, that with the advent of short skirts
and prohibition it was now possible to purchase lipstick
and powder-puff in White Hills. And State Troopers had
been there twice looking for hootch.</p>

<p>There was a rumour in local ecclesiastical circles that the
youth of White Hills was headed hellward.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As yet the sweet-fern was only in tassel; Eris could pick
her way, without danger to her stockings, through the strip
of rough clearing. She entered the woods, pensively, amid
the dappled shadows of new leaves.</p>

<p>Everywhere her eyes discovered young ferns and wild
blossoms. Trillium and bunch-berry were still in bloom;
viburnum, too; violets, blue, yellow and white; and a few
pink moccasin flowers and late anemones.</p>

<p>Birds, too, sang everywhere; crows were noisy in the
taller pines; glimpses of wood-thrush and Veery in moist
thickets; clear little ecstasies of bird-song from high
branches, the strident chirring of red squirrels, the mysterious,
muffled drumming of a cock-grouse far in woodland
depths.</p>

<p>Where a mossy limestone ledge hung low over Whitewater
Brook, Eris spread her handkerchief and sat down on
it carefully, laying her book beside her.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>Here the stillness was melodious with golden harmonies
from a little waterfall.</p>

<p>There were no black flies or midges yet,&mdash;no exasperating
deer-flies either. Only gilded ephemera dancing over
the water, where, at intervals, some burly trout broke with
a splash.</p>

<p>Green-clouded swallow-tail butterflies in floppy, erratic
flight, sped through sunny glades. Overhead sailed the
great yellow swallow-tail,&mdash;in a&euml;rial battle, sometimes with
the Beauty of Camberwell, the latter rather ragged and
faded from last summer&#8217;s gaiety, but with plenty of spirit
left in her shabby wings.</p>

<p>Sun-spots glowed and waned; shadows flickered; water
poured and glided between green banks, aglint with bubbles.
The beauty of all things filled the young heart of Eris, reddened
her lips, tormented her, almost hurt her with the desire
for utterance.</p>

<p>If inexperience really has anything to express, it has no
notion how to go about it.</p>

<p>Like vast, tinted, unreal clouds, her formless thoughts
crowded her mind&mdash;guileless desire, innocent aspiration
toward ineffable heights, ambition as chaste as immature.</p>

<p>And when in dreaming preoccupation the clouds took
vague form, her unformed mind merely mirrored an unreal
shape resembling herself&mdash;a magic dancing shape, ethereal,
triumphant amid Olympian thunders of applause&mdash;a glittering
shape, like hers, lovelier, facing the world from the
jewelled splendour of the stage&mdash;a shadow-shape, gliding
across the screen, worshipped in silence by a breathless
multitude.</p>

<p>She opened her book. It was entitled: &#8220;How to Break
into the Movies.&#8221; She read for a few moments, gave
it up.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was May in the world; and, in the heart of Eris, April.
And a strange, ardent, restlessness in the heart of all youth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
the whole world over&mdash;the renaissance, perhaps, of a
primitive, lawless irresponsibility curbed into discipline
&aelig;ons ago. And, after ages, let loose again since the Twilight
of the World fell over Armageddon.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Sooner or later she felt she must free mind, heart, body
of whatever hampered, and go&mdash;go on about her business in
life&mdash;whatever it might be&mdash;seek it throughout the world&mdash;ask
the way&mdash;ask all things unknown to her&mdash;learn all
things, understand, choose, achieve.</p>

<p>Twenty, in the April just ended! Her time was short.
The time to be about her business in life was very near....
The time was here.... It was already here ... if
she only knew the way.... The way out.... The door
that opened outward....</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Lifting her grey eyes she saw a man across the brook.
He saw her at the same moment.</p>

<p>He was fat. He wore short rubber boots and no coat.
Creel, bait-box, and fishing rod explained his presence on
Whitewater. But as to his having any business there, he
himself seemed in doubt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, sister!&#8221; he said jauntily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello,&#8221; said Eris, politely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it all right for me to fish here?&#8221; he inquired. &#8220;I&#8217;m
not trespassing, am I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;People fish through our woods,&#8221; replied Eris.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, are they <i>your</i> woods?&#8221; He looked around him at
the trees as though to see what kind of sylvan property this
girl possessed.</p>

<p>&#8220;A pretty spot,&#8221; he said with condescension, preparing to
bait his hook. &#8220;I like pretty spots. It&#8217;s my business to
hunt for them, too. Yes, and sometimes I hunt for dreary
spots. Not that I like them, but it&#8217;s in my line&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He
shoved a squirming worm onto the hook and wiped his hands
on his trousers. &#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s my line&mdash;I&#8217;m in all kinds of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
lines&mdash;even fish-lines&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He dropped his hook into the
pool and stood intent, evidently indifferent to any potential
applause as tribute to his wit.</p>

<p>He was sunburnt, fat, smooth-shaven. Thin hair partly
covered his head in damp ringlets.</p>

<p>Presently he glanced across at Eris out of little bluish,
puffy eyes which sagged at the corners. He winked at her,
not offensively:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s my best line, sister.... Spots! All kinds.
Pretty, gloomy, lovely, dreary&mdash;oasis or desert, it doesn&#8217;t
matter; I&#8217;m always in the market for spots.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you looking for a farm?&#8221; inquired Eris.</p>

<p>&#8220;Farm? Well, that&#8217;s in my line, too,&mdash;farms, mills, nice
old stone bridges,&mdash;all that stuff is in my line,&mdash;in fact,
everything is in my line,&mdash;and nothing <i>on</i> my line&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
He lifted a dripping bait, lowered it again, winked at Eris.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; he said, &#8220;there isn&#8217;t a single thing in all the
world that isn&#8217;t in my line. Why, even <i>you</i> are!&#8221; he added,
laughing fatly. &#8220;What do you think of that, now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is your line?&#8221; she inquired, inclined to smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you guess, girlie?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I can&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I come out this way on location. The bunch is
over at Summit. I&#8217;m just scouting out the lay over here.
To-day&#8217;s Sunday, so I&#8217;m fishing. I can&#8217;t hunt spots every
minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what you mean,&#8221; said Eris.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, we&#8217;re shooting the sanitarium over at Summit,&#8221;
he explained, gently testing his line. As there was nothing
on it he looked over at Eris.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t get me, sister,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s pictures.
See?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Moving pictures?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yeh, the Crystal Film outfit. We&#8217;re shooting the &#8216;Wild
Girl.&#8217; It&#8217;s all outside stuff now. We&#8217;re going to shoot
&#8216;The Piker&#8217; next. Nature stuff. That&#8217;s why.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>Once more he drew out and examined his bait. &#8220;Say,&#8221;
he demanded, &#8220;are there any fish in this stream?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Trout.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, they seem to be darned scarce&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to ask you something,&#8221; interrupted the girl,
breathlessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shoot, sister.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to know how people&mdash;how a girl&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure. I get you. I&#8217;m glad you asked me. They all
ask that. You want to know how to get into pictures.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course. So does every living female in the United
States. That&#8217;s what sixty million women, young and old,
want to know&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked up, prepared to wink, but something in her
flushed expression modified his jocose intention:</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, sister,&#8221; he drawled, &#8220;<i>you</i> don&#8217;t want to go into
pictures.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why are <i>you</i> in pictures?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;God knows&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you please tell me why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I like the job, I guess.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So do I.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, very well,&#8221; he said, laughing, &#8220;go to it, girlie.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, <i>I</i> can&#8217;t tell you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You <i>can</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>He lifted his bait and flopped it into another place.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, listen,&#8221; he said, &#8220;some men would take notice of
your pretty face and kid you along. That ain&#8217;t me. If
you break loose and go into pictures it&#8217;s a one to a million
shot you make carfare.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to try.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>I</i> can&#8217;t give you a job, sister&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>&#8220;Would the Crystal Film management let me try?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nobody would let you try unless they needed an extra.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is an extra?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A day&#8217;s jobber. Maybe several days. Then it&#8217;s hoofing
it after the next job.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t they let me try a small part?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re cast. You got to begin as an extra, anyhow.
There&#8217;s nothing else to it, girlie&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Something jerked his line; gingerly he lifted the rod, not
&#8220;striking&#8221;; a plump trout fell from the hook into the water.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lost him, by jinx!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;What the devil
did I do that I hadn&#8217;t oughto I dunno?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You should jerk when a trout bites. You just lifted
him out. You can&#8217;t hook a trout that way.... I hope
you will be kind enough to give me your name and address,
and help me to get into pictures.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a while he stood silent, re-baiting his hook. When
he was ready he cast the line into the water, laid the rod
on the bank, drew out and lighted a large, pallid cigar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; he remarked, &#8220;your parents are against your
going into pictures.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My mother is dead. My stepmother only laughs at me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How about papa?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He wouldn&#8217;t like it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Same old scenario,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And I&#8217;ll give you the
same old advice: if you got a good home, stay put. Have
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you don&#8217;t want to stay put?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You want to run away and-be-a-great-actress?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to try.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Try to do what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Find out what I can do and do it!&#8221; she replied hotly,
almost on the verge of tears.</p>

<p>He looked up at the delicate, flushed beauty of her face.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>It wasn&#8217;t a question of talent. Most women have the
actress in them. With or lacking intelligence it can be
developed enough for Broadway use.</p>

<p>&#8220;You young girls,&#8221; he said, &#8220;expect to travel everywhere
on your looks. And some of you do. And they last as
long as their looks last. But men get nowhere without
brains.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have brains,&#8221; she retorted unsteadily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let it go at that. But where&#8217;s your experience?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How can I have it unless I&mdash;I try?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You think acting is your vocation, sister?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I intend to find out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You better listen to me and stick to a good home while
the sticking&#8217;s good!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going into pictures,&#8221; she said slowly. &#8220;And that&#8217;s
<i>that</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>Wearying of bad luck the fat man started to move down
stream toward another pool.</p>

<p>The girl rose straight up on her mossy rock, joining both
hands in classic appeal, quite unconscious of her dramatic
attitude.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please&mdash;<i>please</i> tell me who you are and where you
live!&#8221; she beseeched him.</p>

<p>He was inclined to laugh; then her na&iuml;vet&eacute; touched him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, sister,&#8221; he said, &#8220;if you put it that way&mdash;my name
is Quiss&mdash;Harry B. Quiss. I live in New York&mdash;Hotel
Huron. You can find me there when I&#8217;m not on location
or at the studio.... The Crystal Films Corporation.
We&#8217;re in the telephone book.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Quiss might have added that the Crystal Films Corporation
was also on its beam-ends. But he couldn&#8217;t quite
do that. All he could say was: &#8220;Better stick to papa while
the sticking&#8217;s good, girlie. There&#8217;s no money in pictures.
They all bust sooner or later. Take it from one who&#8217;s been
blown sky-high more&#8217;n twice. And expects to go up more&#8217;n
twice more.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>He went slowly toward the pool below, gesticulating with
his rod for emphasis:</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no money in pictures&mdash;not even for stars. I
don&#8217;t know where it all goes to. Don&#8217;t ask me who gets it.
I don&#8217;t, anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p class="drop-cap">ON Monday evening at five o&#8217;clock the Whitewater herd
was ready for milking.</p>

<p>Odell, Ed Lister, and the foreman, Gene Lyford, scrubbed
their hands and faces and put on clean white canvas clothes.
Clyde Storm, helper, went along the lime-freshened concrete
alleys, shaking out bran and tossing in clover-hay. Everywhere
in the steel stanchions beautiful Guernsey heads were
turned to watch his progress. In the bull-pen the herd-bull
pried and butted at the bars. The barn vibrated with his
contented lowing.</p>

<p>Calves in their pens came crowding to the bars like herded
deer, or went bucketing about, excited to playful combat
by the social gathering after an all-day separation.</p>

<p>In the stalls sleek flanks were being wiped down until
they glistened like the coats of thoroughbred horses; udders
were washed with tepid water; the whole place smelled
fresh and clean as a hayfield.</p>

<p>No mechanical apparatus was employed at Whitewater
Farms.</p>

<p>Odell, finished with the first cow, carried the foaming
pail to the steelyards, weighed it, noted the result on the
bulletin with a pencil that dangled there, and stepped aside
to make room for Ed Lister, who came up with a brimming
pail.</p>

<p>There was little conversation at milking hour, scarcely a
word spoken except in admonition or reassurance to some
restless cow&mdash;no sounds in the barn save the herd-bull&#8217;s
deep rumble of well-being, a gusty twitter of swallows from
the eaves, the mellow noises of feeding cattle, clank and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
creak of stanchion, gush and splash of water as some thirsty
cow buried her pink nose in the patent fonts.</p>

<p>The still air grew fragrant with the scent of milk and
clover-hay.</p>

<p>One or two grey cats came in, hopefully, and sat on the
ladder-stairs, purring, observant, receptive.</p>

<p>The cows on test were in the western extension, all
becoming a trifle restless now that their hour was again
approaching. And presently two of Odell&#8217;s sons, Si and
Willis, came in, scrubbed and clothed in white, prepared to
continue the exhaustive record already well initiated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eris home yet?&#8221; asked Odell over his shoulder.</p>

<p>Si shook his head and picked up a pail.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, where&#8217;n the dang-dinged town is she?&#8221; growled
Odell. &#8220;If she&#8217;s staying som&#8217;mers to supper, why can&#8217;t
she send word?&#8221;</p>

<p>Willis said: &#8220;Buddy went down street to look for her.
Mommy sent him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys passed on into the extension where the comely
cattle on test stood impatient.</p>

<p>Odell remarked to Lister: &#8220;Ever since Eris drove over
to Summit to see them pitcher people makin&#8217; movies she&#8217;s
acted sulky and contrary like. Now look at her stayin&#8217;
away all day&mdash;&#8217;n&#8217; out to supper, too, som&#8217;mers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She acts like she&#8217;s sot on sunthin&#8217;,&#8221; suggested Lister,
adjusting his milking stool and clasping the pail between
his knees.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s sot on j&#8217;ining some danged moving pitcher
comp&#8217;ny,&#8221; grunted Odell. &#8220;That&#8217;s what&#8217;s in her head all
the time these days.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lister&#8217;s pail hummed with alternate streams of milk
drumming on the tin. For a while he milked in silence
save for a low-voiced remonstrance to the young and temperamental
Guernsey whose near hind leg threatened
trouble.</p>

<p>As he rose with the brimming pail he said: &#8220;I guess Eris<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
is a good girl. I guess she wouldn&#8217;t go so far as to do
nothin&#8217; rash, Elmer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I dunno. You couldn&#8217;t never tell what Fanny had in
her head. Fanny allus had her secret thoughts. I never
knowed what she was figurin&#8217; out. Eris acts that way;
she does what she&#8217;s told but she thinks as she&#8217;s a mind to.
Too much brain ain&#8217;t healthy for no woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lister weighed his pail, scratched down the record opposite
the cow&#8217;s name, turned and looked back at Odell.</p>

<p>&#8220;Women oughta think the way their men-folks tell &#8217;em,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;That&#8217;s my idee. But the way they vote and
carry on these days is a-sp&#8217;ilin&#8217; on &#8217;em, accordin&#8217; to my way
of figurin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>Odell said nothing. As he stood weighing his pail of
milk, Buddy came into the barn, eating a stick of shop
candy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, pa,&#8221; he called out, &#8220;mommy wants you up to the
house!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When? Now?&#8221; demanded his father in dull surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess so. She said you was to come right up.&#8221;</p>

<p>Odell placed the empty milk pail on the floor: &#8220;Eris home
yet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I dunno. I guess not. Will you let me milk Snow-bird,
pa?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. Look at your hands! You go up and shake down
some hay.... Where&#8217;s your ma?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s up in Eris&#8217; room. She says for you to come.
Can&#8217;t I wash my hands and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. G&#8217;wan up to the loft. And don&#8217;t step on the pitchfork,
neither.&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned uncertainly toward Lister and found his
father-in-law looking at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Kinda queer,&#8221; he muttered, &#8220;Mazie sending for me
when she knows I&#8217;m milking....&#8221;</p>

<p>Lister made no comment. Odell went out heavily, crossed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
the farm yard in the pleasant sunset glow, walked on
toward the house with lagging stride.</p>

<p>As he set foot on the porch he became conscious of his
irritation, felt the heat of it in his cheeks&mdash;the same old
familiar resentment which had smouldered through the
dingy, discordant years of his first marriage.</p>

<p>Here it was again, creeping through him after all these
placid years with Mazie&mdash;the same sullen apprehension, dull
unease verging on anger, invading his peace of mind, stirred
this time by Fanny&#8217;s child&mdash;Eris, daughter of Discord.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dang Fanny&#8217;s breed,&#8221; he muttered, entering the house,
&#8220;&mdash;we allus was enemies deep down, ... deep down in
the flesh....&#8221;</p>

<p>All at once he understood his real mind. Eris had
always been Fanny&#8217;s child. Never his. He remembered
what Fanny had said to him at the approach of death&mdash;how,
in that last desperate moment the battered mask of
years had slipped from her bony visage and he had gazed
into the stark face of immemorial antipathy, ... the
measureless resentment of a sex.</p>

<p>Fanny was dead. May God find out what she wants
and give it to her. But Fanny&#8217;s race persisted. She lived
again in Eris. He was face to face with it again....
After twenty years of peace!...</p>

<p>He went to the foot of the stairs and called to his wife.
Her voice answered from the floor above. He plodded on
upstairs.</p>

<p>Mazie was standing in Eris&#8217; room, a pile of clothing on
the bed, a suitcase and a small, flat trunk open on the
floor.</p>

<p>She turned to Odell, her handsome features flushed, and
the sparkle of tears in her slanting, black eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the trouble now?&#8221; he demanded, already divining
it.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s gone, Elmer. She called me up on the telephone
from Albany to tell me. The Crystal Fillum Company<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
offers her a contract. She wants her clothes and her
money.&#8221;</p>

<p>A heavy colour surged through the man&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the danged secret blood in her,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I
knowed it. There&#8217;s allus sunthin&#8217; hatchin&#8217; deep down in
women of her blood.... She&#8217;s allus had it in her mind
to quit us.... She never was one of us.... All right,
let her go. I&#8217;m done with her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mazie began unsteadily: &#8220;So many children of&mdash;of our
day seem to feel like our Eris&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mine don&#8217;t! My boys ain&#8217;t got nothin&#8217; secret into
them! They ain&#8217;t crazy in the head &#8217;n&#8217; they ain&#8217;t full o&#8217;
fool notions.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mazie remained silent. Her sons were fuller of &#8220;notions&#8221;
than their father knew. It had required all the magnetism
of her affection and authority to keep them headed toward
a future on Whitewater Farms. For the nearest town was
already calling them; they sniffed the soft-coal smoke from
afar and were restless for the iron dissonance and human
bustle of paved and narrow ways.</p>

<p>Theirs was the gregarious excitement instinct in human
animals. Beyond the dingy monochrome of life they
caught a glimmer of distant brightness. The vague summons
of unknown but suspected pleasures stirred them as
they travelled the sodden furrow.</p>

<p>Youth&#8217;s physical instinct is to gather at the water-hole
of this vast veldt we call the world, and wallow in the
inviting mire of a thousand hoofs, and feel and hear and
see the perpetual milling of the human herds that gather
there.</p>

<p>Only in quality did Eris differ from her brothers. It
was her mind&mdash;and the untasted pleasures of the mind&mdash;that
drove her to the common fount.</p>

<p>There is a picture by Fragonard called &#8220;The Fountain
of Love.&#8221; And, as eagerly as the blond and glowing girl
speeds to the brimming basin where mischievous little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
winged Loves pour out for her the magic waters, so impetuously
had Eris sped toward the fount of knowledge,
hot, parched with desire to set her lips to immortal springs.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Odell&#8217;s heavy eyes, brooding anger, followed Mazie&#8217;s
movements as she smoothed out the clothing and laid each
garment in the trunk.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to do that,&#8221; he growled. &#8220;Let her
come and get &#8217;em if she wants &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But she needs&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dang it, let &#8217;em lay. Like&#8217;s not she&#8217;ll sicken o&#8217; them
pitcher people before the week&#8217;s out. She&#8217;ll get her belly
full o&#8217; notions. Let her caper till she runs into barbed wire.
That&#8217;ll sting some sense into her hide.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She only took her little leather bag, Elmer&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll sicken sooner. I ain&#8217;t worryin&#8217; none. She ain&#8217;t
a loose girl; she&#8217;s just a fool heifer that goes bucketin&#8217; over
a snake-fence where it&#8217;s half down. Let her kick up and
skylark. You bet she&#8217;ll hear the farm bell when it comes
supper time&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned away exasperated, but Mazie took him by the
sleeve of his milking jacket:</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s got to have money, Elmer&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, she hain&#8217;t! She&#8217;ll sicken the quicker&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Elmer, it&#8217;s her money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tain&#8217;t. It&#8217;s mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s her heifer-money&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She shan&#8217;t have it! Not till she&#8217;s twenty-one. And
that&#8217;s that!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mazie looked at her husband in a distressed way, her
black eyes full of tears:</p>

<p>&#8220;Elmer, you can&#8217;t use a girl like a boy. A girl&#8217;s a tender
thing. And I was afraid of this&mdash;something like this....
Because Eris is a mite different. She likes to read and
study. She likes to figure out what she reads about. She
likes music and statues and art-things like the hand-painted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
pictures we saw in Utica. There&#8217;s no harm in art, I guess....
And you know how she always did love to dress up
for church plays&mdash;and how nicely she sang and danced and
acted in school&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dang it all!&#8221; shouted Odell, beating one tanned fist
within the other palm, &#8220;let her come home and cut her
capers! She can do them things when there&#8217;s a entertainment
down to the church, can&#8217;t she?</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s enough for any girl, ain&#8217;t it? And she can go
to Utica and look at them hand-painted pitchers in the
store windows. And she can dance to socials and showers
like sensible girls and she can sing her head off Sundays
in church when she&#8217;s a mind to!</p>

<p>&#8220;All she&#8217;s gotta do is come home and git the best of
everything. But as long as she acts crazy and stays away,
I&#8217;m done with her. And that&#8217;s that!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">SPRING had begun more than a month early. The
young year promised agricultural miracles. All omens
were favourable. Ed Lister predicted it would be a &#8220;hog-killin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>June&#8217;s magic turned Whitewater to a paradise. Crystal
mornings gradually warming until sundown; gentle showers
at night to freshen herbage and start a million planted seeds;
blossoms, bees, buds, blue skies&mdash;all exquisitely balanced
designs in June&#8217;s enchanted tapestry&mdash;and nothing so far
to mar the fabric&mdash;no late and malignant frost, no early
drouth, broken violently by thunderbolt and deluge; no
hail; no heavy winds to dry and sear; nothing untoward
in the herd,&mdash;no milk-fever, no abortion, no terrifying
emergency at night.</p>

<p>The only things to irritate Odell were the letters from
Eris. They aroused in him the dumb, familiar anger of
Fanny&#8217;s time.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But after the first week in July there were no longer any
letters from Eris. The girl had written two or three times
during June, striving to explain herself, to make him understand
her need of doing as she was doing, the necessity that
some of her own money be sent her.</p>

<p>Her last letter arrived about the beginning of that dreadful
era of unprecedented heat and drouth which ushered in July
and which caused that summer to be long remembered in
the Old World as well as in the New.</p>

<p>Odell&#8217;s refusal to send her a single penny, and his repeated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
summons for her return had finally silenced Eris. No more
letters came. Odell&#8217;s attitude silenced Mazie, too, whose
primitive sense of duty was to her man first of all.</p>

<p>Sometimes she ventured to hope that Eris might, somehow,
be successful. Oftener a comforting belief reassured
her that the girl would soon return to material comforts and
female duties, which were all Mazie comprehended of earthly
happiness.</p>

<p>Odell&#8217;s refusal to send Eris her money and her clothes
worried Mazie when she had time to think. But what could
she do? Man ruled Mazie&#8217;s universe. It was proper that
he should. All her life she had had to submit to him,&mdash;she
had to cook for him, wash, sew, mend, care for his
habitation, bear his children, fed them, wean them, and, in
the endless sequence again, cook, wash, iron, sew, mend
for these men-children which she had borne her man.
And it was proper. It was the way of the world. Of
heaven, too, perhaps. God himself was masculine....
She sometimes wondered whether there really was any rest
there for female angels....</p>

<p>Of what other women desired and did,&mdash;of aspiration,
spiritual and intellectual discontent, Mazie knew nothing.
For her nothing desirable existed beyond the barbed wire.
And yet, without at all understanding Eris, always she had
felt an odd sympathy for the girl&#8217;s irregularities&mdash;had
recognized that Fanny&#8217;s child was different from herself,
from her offspring&mdash;from other women&#8217;s children. But
the underlying motive that had sent Eris forth was quite
beyond Mazie&#8217;s ken. The resurrection of her sex came too
early for her who had not yet died.</p>

<p>The farm year had begun prosperously. Until July there
had been no cloud on the horizon. In imagination Odell
gazed across acres and acres of golden harvest; saw a beneficent
and paternal Government coming to the relief of all
farmers; saw every silo packed, every barn bursting; saw
the steady increase of the herd balanced by profitable sales;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
saw ribbons and prizes awaiting his exhibits at County and
State Fairs.</p>

<p>Yet, very often after supper, when standing on the porch
chewing his quid as stolidly as his cows chewed their cuds,
he was aware of a vague unease&mdash;as in Fanny&#8217;s day.</p>

<p>He could not comprehend the transmission of resentment
from Fanny to Fanny&#8217;s child. He could much less understand
the inherited resentment of a sex, now for the first
time since creation making its defiance subtly felt the whole
world through. <i>Sub jugum ad astra!</i> And now the Yoke
had fallen; stars blazed beyond. Restless-winged, a Sex
stood poised for flight, turning deaf ears to earthbound
voices calling them back to hoods and bells and jesses.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One stifling hot night in July, after two weeks&#8217; enervating
drouth, Odell&#8217;s impotent wrath burst from the depths of bitterness
long pent:</p>

<p>&#8220;That ding-danged slut will shame us yet if she don&#8217;t come
back! I&#8217;m done with her if she ain&#8217;t in her own bed by
Monday night. You write and tell her, Mazie. Tell her
I&#8217;m through. Tell her I say so. And that&#8217;s that!&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The &#8220;ding-danged slut&#8221; at that moment lay asleep on the
grass in a New York public park. And all around her, on
the hot and trampled grass, lay half-naked, beastly, breathing
human heaps&mdash;the heat-tortured hordes of the unwashed.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">JULY began badly in New York. Ambulances became
busy, hospitals overcrowded, seaside resorts thronged.
Day after day a heavy atmosphere hung like a saturated and
steaming blanket over the city. The daily papers recorded
deaths from heat. Fountains were full of naked urchins
unmolested by police. Firemen drenched the little children
of the poor with heavy showers from hose and stand-pipe.</p>

<p>Toward midnight, on the tenth day of the heat, a slight
freshness tempered the infernal atmosphere of the streets.
It was almost a breeze. In the Park dry leaves rustled
slightly. Sleepers on bench and withered sward stirred,
sighed, relaxed again into semi-stupor.</p>

<p>Two men in light clothes and straw hats, crossing the
Park from West to East, paused on the asphalt path to gaze
upon the thousands of prostrate figures.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yonder&#8217;s a sob-stuff story for you, Barry,&#8221; remarked the
shorter man.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s more than one story there,&#8221; said the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, only one. I&#8217;ll tell you that story: these people had
rather work and die in their putrid tenements than work
and live in the wholesome countryside. You can&#8217;t kick
these town rats out of their rat-ridden city. They like to
fester and swarm. And when any species swarms, Barry,
Nature presently decimates it.&#8221;</p>

<p>They moved along slowly, looking out over the dim
meadows heaped with unstirring forms.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; admitted Annan, who had been addressed as
Barry, &#8220;the mass story is about what you outlined, Mike;
but there are other stories there&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He made a slight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
gesture toward the meadow, &#8220;The whole gamut from farce
to tragedy....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The only drama in that mess is rooted in stupidity.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s where all tragedy is rooted.... I could step in
among those people and in ten minutes I could bring back
material for a Hugo, a Balzac, a Maupassant, a Dumas&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you? It&#8217;s your job to look for literary loot
in human scrap heaps. Here&#8217;s life&#8217;s dumping ground.
You&#8217;re the chiffonier. Why not start business?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m considering it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go to it,&#8221; laughed the other, lighting a cigarette and
leaning gracefully on his walking stick. &#8220;Yonder&#8217;s the
sewer; dig out your diamond. Uproot your lily!&#8221;</p>

<p>Annan said: &#8220;Do you want to bet I can&#8217;t go in there,
wake up one of those unwashed, and, in ten minutes, get the
roots of a story as good as any ever written?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you weren&#8217;t in a class by yourself,&#8221; said the other,
&#8220;I&#8217;d bet with you. Any ordinary newspaper man could go
in there and dig up a dozen obvious news items. But you&#8217;ll
dig up a commonplace item and turn it into an epic. Or
you&#8217;ll dig up none at all, and come back with a corker&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll play square&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know <i>you</i>! The biggest story in the world, Barry,
was born a punk little news item; and it would have died
an item except for the genius who covered it. You&#8217;re one
of those damned geniuses&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t try to hedge!&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t tell <i>me</i>! Nothing ever really happens except in
clever brains. I can condense Hamlet&#8217;s story into a paragraph.
But I&#8217;m glad Shakespeare didn&#8217;t. I&#8217;m glad the
Apostles were&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a crazy Irishman, Coltfoot,&#8221; remarked Annan,
looking about him at the thousands of spectral sleepers.
&#8220;Shut up. I need a story and I&#8217;m going to get one....
You don&#8217;t want to take my bet, do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right. Ten dollars that you don&#8217;t get the honest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
makings of a real story in ten minutes. No faking! No
creative genius stuff. Just bald facts.&#8221; He looked at his
wrist-watch, then at his companion. &#8220;Ready?&#8221;</p>

<p>Annan nodded, glanced out over the waste of withered
grass. As he stepped from the asphalt to the meadow a
tepid breeze began to blow, cooling his perspiring cheeks.</p>

<p>A few sleepers stirred feverishly. Under a wilted shrub
a girl lifted her heavy head from the satchel that had pillowed
it. Then, slowly, she sat upright to face the faint stir
of air.</p>

<p>Her hat fell off. She passed slim fingers through her
bobbed hair, ruffling it to the cool wind blowing.</p>

<p>Annan walked directly toward her, picking his way across
the grass among the sleeping heaps of people.</p>

<p>As he stopped beside her, Eris looked up at him out of
tired eyes which seemed like wells of shadow, giving her
pinched face an appearance almost skull-like.</p>

<p>Annan mistook her age, as did everybody; and he calmly
squatted down on his haunches as though condescending
to a child.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be afraid to talk to me,&#8221; he said in his easy, persuasive
way. &#8220;I write stories for newspapers. I&#8217;m looking
for a story now. If you&#8217;ll tell me your story I&#8217;ll give you
ten dollars.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eris stared at him without comprehension. The increasing
breeze blew her mop of chestnut curls upward from a
brow as white as milk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; he said in his pleasant voice, &#8220;there are ten perfectly
good dollars in it for you. All I want of you is your
story&mdash;not your real name, of course,&mdash;just a few plain
facts explaining how you happen to be sleeping here in
Central Park with your little satchel for your pillow and
the sky for your bed-clothes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eris remained motionless, one slender hand buried in the
grass, the other resting against her temples. The blessed
breeze began to winnow her hair again.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you talk to me?&#8221; urged Annan. &#8220;You&#8217;re not
afraid, are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what to say to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just tell me how you happen to be sleeping here in the
Park to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have to save my money&mdash;&#8221; She yawned and concealed
her lips with one hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please excuse me,&#8221; she murmured, &#8220;I haven&#8217;t slept very
well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you have <i>some</i> money?&#8221; he inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have twenty dollars.... Money doesn&#8217;t last long in
New York.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it doesn&#8217;t,&#8221; agreed Annan gravely. &#8220;Did you work
in a shop?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In pictures.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Moving pictures?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. I have a contract with the Crystal Films.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes. I heard about that outfit. It blew up. Did
they ever pay you any salary?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you happen to hook up with that bunch of
crooks?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think they are crooks. Mr. Quiss isn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;I think he looks up places to photograph&mdash;and he
supplies extras&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A scout. Where did you run into him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Near my home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did your parents permit you to join that flossy outfit?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see. You ran away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;went away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Could you go home now if you wished to?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t wish to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you must believe that you really possess dramatic
talent.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>Eris passed her fingers wearily through her hair: &#8220;I am
trying to learn something,&#8221; she said, as though to herself.
&#8220;I think I have talents.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it you most desire to be?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I like to act ... and dance.... I&#8217;d like to write a
play ... or a book ... or something....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Like other people, you&#8217;re after fame and fortune. I&#8217;m
chasing them, too. Everybody is. But the world&#8217;s goal
remains the same, no matter what you are hunting. That
goal is Happiness.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at him, heavy-eyed, silent. She yawned
slightly, murmured an excuse, rubbed her eyes with her forefinger.</p>

<p>&#8220;Which is your principal object in life, fame or fortune?&#8221;
he inquired, smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are those the principal objects in life?&#8221; she asked, so
na&iuml;vely that he suspected her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some believe that love is more important,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Do
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>She rested her pale cheek on her hand: &#8220;No,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then what <i>is</i> your principal object in life?&#8221; he asked,
watching her intently.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think, more than anything, I desire education.&#8221;</p>

<p>His surprise was followed by further suspicion. Her
reply sounded too na&iuml;ve, too moral. He became wary of
the latent actress in her.</p>

<p>She sat there huddled up, brooding, gazing into the darkness
out of haunted eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think an education is really worth this sort of
hardship?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>That seemed to interest her. She replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;I think so.... I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you trying to learn?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The truth ... about things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you go to school?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been through high-school.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you learn the truth about things in high-school?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are you going to learn it then?&#8221;</p>

<p>She was plainly interested now:</p>

<p>&#8220;I think the only way is to find out for myself.... I
don&#8217;t know anybody who can tell me reasons. I like to be
told <i>why</i>. If I don&#8217;t know the facts about life how can I
write plays and act them? I <i>must</i> find out. I&#8217;m twenty,
and I know scarcely anything worth knowing. It is awful.
It frightens me. I&#8217;m crazy to be somebody. I can&#8217;t be
unless I learn the truth about things.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is nobody at home to tell me.... I couldn&#8217;t
stand it any longer.... I <i>had</i> to find out for myself.
Books don&#8217;t help. They excite.&#8221; She looked at him feverishly:
&#8220;It is a terrible thing to want only facts,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;Because nothing else satisfies.&#8221;</p>

<p>He thought, incredulously, &#8220;Where did she get that line?&#8221;
He said: &#8220;A taste for Truth spoils one&#8217;s appetite for anything
else.... So that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re after, is it? You&#8217;re
after the truth about things.&#8221;</p>

<p>She did not reply.</p>

<p>He said, always watching her: &#8220;When you know the
truth what are you going to do with it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Act it. Write it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Live it, too?&#8221; he inquired gravely.</p>

<p>She turned to look at him, not comprehending.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are you going to get the money to do all this?&#8221;
he asked lightly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is going to be difficult&mdash;without money,&#8221; she admitted.</p>

<p>Something in the situation stirred a perverse sort of
humour in him. He didn&#8217;t quite believe in her, as she
revealed her complexities and her simplicities out of her own
mouth.</p>

<p>&#8220;The love of money is the root of all good,&#8221; he remarked.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>After a silence: &#8220;I wonder,&#8221; she said thoughtfully.
&#8220;One needs it to do good ... perhaps to <i>be</i> good....
Nobody can tell, I suppose, what starvation might do to
them.... Money <i>is</i> good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All things are difficult without money,&#8221; he said, pursuing
his perverse thesis. &#8220;The love of it is not the root of all
evil. Money is often salvation. Lack of it fetters effort.
Want of it retards fulfilment. Without it ambition is
crippled. Aspiration remains a dream. Lacking a penny-worth
of bread, Hamlet had never been written.... I think
I&#8217;ll say as much in my next story.&#8221;</p>

<p>His was an easy and humorous tongue, facile and creative,
too&mdash;it being his business to juggle nimbly with ideas
and amuse an audience at so much a column.</p>

<p>Eris listened, unaware that he was poking fun at himself.
Her shadowy eyes were intent on his in the starlight. The
white, sharp contours of her face interested him. He was
alert for any word or tone or gesture done for dramatic
effect.</p>

<p>&#8220;So that&#8217;s your story, then,&#8221; he said in his gay, agreeable
voice. &#8220;You are a little pilgrim of Minerva in quest of
Wisdom, travelling afoot through the world with an empty
wallet and no staff to comfort you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand what you mean,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Minerva was
goddess of Wisdom. We had mythology in high-school.&#8221;</p>

<p>He thought: &#8220;She&#8217;s a clever comedienne or an utter
baby.&#8221; He said: &#8220;Is that really all there is to your story?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no story.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No ill-treatment at home to warrant your running
away?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not even an unhappy love affair?&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook her head slightly as though embarrassed.</p>

<p>&#8220;How old are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Twenty in April.&#8221;</p>

<p>Annan was silent. He had not supposed her to be over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
seventeen. She had seemed little more than a child in the
starlight when she sat up ruffling her bobbed hair in the first
tepid breeze.</p>

<p>She said seriously: &#8220;I am growing old. And if I have
talent I have no time to waste. That is why I went away
at the first opportunity.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are your talents?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I dance. I have acted in school plays. Once I wrote
a one-act piece for myself. They liked it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go ahead and tell me about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>She told him how she had written the act and how she had
sung and danced. Stimulated by the memory of her little
success, she ventured to speak of her connection with the
Crystal Films. Then, suddenly, the long-pent flood of
trouble poured out of her lonely heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;I drove over to Summit,&#8221; she said, &#8220;where they had
been shooting an exterior. Mr. Quiss introduced me to
Mr. Donnell, the director. Mr. Donnell said that they were
just leaving for Albany on location, and he couldn&#8217;t give
me a test. So I went to Albany the next morning&mdash;I just
packed my night-clothes and walked all the way to Gayfield
to catch the six o&#8217;clock morning train. It was my first
chance. I seemed to realise that. I took fifty dollars I had
saved. I have spent thirty of it already.</p>

<p>&#8220;At Albany Mr. Donnell had a test made of me. It
turned out well. He offered me a contract. I telephoned
to my stepmother and told her what I had done. I explained
that I needed money.... I have some money of
my own. But my father wouldn&#8217;t let me have it. I wrote
several times, but they only told me to come home. They
wouldn&#8217;t let me have any money.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, when the company arrived at the New York studio,
Mr. Donnell seemed to be in trouble. We were not paid. I
heard Mr. Quiss say that the principals had received no salary
for a month. He said that Mr. Donnell had not been
paid, either. The carpenters who were building sets refused<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
to go on until they had their wages. Somebody cut off the
electric current. Our dynamo stopped. We stood around
all day. Somebody said that the bankers who owned the
Crystal Films were in financial difficulties.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, the next morning, when we reported for work at
the studio, we found it locked. I was sorry for our company.
Even the principals seemed to be in need of money.
Mr. Quiss was very kind to me. He offered to pay my
fare back home. But I wouldn&#8217;t go. Mr. Donnell offered
to lend me ten dollars, but I told him I had twenty. He
gave me a nice letter to the Elite Agency. Mr. Quiss
promised to keep me in mind. But the agencies tell me
that all the film companies are letting their people go this
summer. I can&#8217;t seem to find any work. They tell me
there won&#8217;t be any work until October.... I&#8217;m saving
my twenty dollars. And I&#8217;m wondering what I shall find
to do to keep busy until October.... Even if I could
afford a room, I don&#8217;t need it. It is too hot in New York
to sleep indoors.... I can wash my face and hands in
the ladies&#8217; room of any hotel. I give the maid five cents....
But I don&#8217;t know what to do for a bath. I must do
something.... I shall hire a room for a day and wash
myself and my clothes.... You see, twenty dollars doesn&#8217;t
go very far in New York.... I wonder how far I can
go on it.... Do you know what would be the very
cheapest way to live on twenty dollars until October?&#8221;</p>

<p>After a silence Annan said: &#8220;I owe you ten for your
story. That makes thirty dollars.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh. But I can&#8217;t take money from <i>you</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t earned it. I had no story to tell you. I&#8217;ve
only talked to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Annan, sitting cross-legged on the grass, clasped his knees
with both arms. He said, coolly:</p>

<p>&#8220;I offered you ten dollars for your story. That was too
little to offer for such a story. It&#8217;s worth more.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>&#8220;Why, it isn&#8217;t worth anything,&#8221; she retorted. &#8220;I hadn&#8217;t
any story to tell you. I shan&#8217;t let you give me money just
because I&#8217;ve talked to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you guess how much I shall be paid by my newspaper
for writing out this story you have told me?&#8221; he asked,
smiling at her in the starlight.</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I won&#8217;t bother you with details; but your commission
in this transaction will be considerable. Your commission
will amount to a hundred dollars.&#8221;</p>

<p>She sat so rigid and unstirring that he leaned a little
toward her to see her expression. It was flushed and
hostile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think I am joking?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what you are doing.&#8221;</p>

<p>He said: &#8220;I&#8217;m not mean enough to make a joke of your
predicament. I&#8217;m telling you very honestly that I can construct
a first-rate short story out of the story you have
just told me. I&#8217;m workman enough to do it. That&#8217;s my
job.</p>

<p>&#8220;Every week I write a short story for the Sunday edition
of the New York <i>Planet</i>. My stories have become popular.
My name is becoming rather well known. I am now paid
so well for my stories that I can afford to pay well for the
idea you have given me. Your story is full of ideas, and it&#8217;s
worth about a hundred dollars to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t worth a cent,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want you to
offer me money.... Or anything....&#8221; She laid both
hands against her forehead as though her head ached, and
sat huddled up, elbows resting on her knees. Presently she
yawned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please excuse me,&#8221; she murmured, &#8220;I seem to be
tired.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a long silence. Annan turned his head to see
if his friend Coltfoot still waited. Not discovering him,
he inspected his watch. Surprised, he lit a match to make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
certain of the time; and discovered that he had been talking
with this girl for more than an hour and a half.</p>

<p>He said to her in his pleasant, persuasive voice: &#8220;You&#8217;re
not afraid of me, are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked up, white and tired: &#8220;I&#8217;m not afraid of
anybody.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;re not entirely right. However, if you&#8217;re not
afraid of me, suppose I help you find a room to-night. You
can afford a room now.&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;You intend to stay here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better not stay here with a hundred and twenty
dollars in your pocket.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shan&#8217;t take money from you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you want me to lose five hundred dollars?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How?&#8221; she asked, bewildered by the sudden impatience
in his voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I write the story I get six hundred. I won&#8217;t write it
unless you take your commission.&#8221;</p>

<p>She said nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; he said, almost sharply. &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to
leave you here. You need a bath, anyway. You can&#8217;t get a
good rest unless you have a bath.&#8221;</p>

<p>He sprang up from the grass, took her hand before she
could withdraw it, and drew her forcibly to her feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe you&#8217;re twenty,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but some cop is likely
to take you to the Arsenal as a lost child.&#8221;</p>

<p>She seemed so startled that he reassured her with a
smile,&mdash;stooped to pick up her hat and satchel, still smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, little pilgrim,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it&#8217;s two o&#8217;clock in the
morning, and the Temple of Wisdom is closed. Bath and
bed is your best bet.&#8221;</p>

<p>She pinned on her hat mechanically, smoothed her
wrinkled dress. Then she looked up at him in a dazed way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ready?&#8221; he asked gently.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>&#8220;Yes. What do you want me to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go,&#8221; he said lightly, and took her by the hand again.</p>

<p>Slowly through starry darkness he guided her between
prone shapes on the grass, and so along the asphalt, east, until
the silvery lamps of Fifth Avenue stretched away before
them in endless, level constellations.</p>

<p>He was beginning to wonder where to take her at such
an hour. But to the sort of mind that was Annan&#8217;s, direct
method and simple solution always appealed. He came to
a swift conclusion,&mdash;came to it the more easily because it
was an amusing one.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not afraid of me, you say?&#8221; he repeated.</p>

<p>She shook her head. &#8220;You seem kind.... Should I
be?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, not in my case,&#8221; he said, laughing.... &#8220;We&#8217;ll
take that taxi&mdash;&#8221; He hailed it, gave directions, and seated
himself beside her, now keenly amused.</p>

<p>&#8220;Little pilgrim,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you&#8217;re going to have a good
scrub, a good sleep in a good bed, and a jolly good breakfast
when you wake up. <i>What</i> do you think of that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what to think.... I have found much
kindness among strangers.&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughed and lighted a cigarette. The avenue was
nearly deserted. At Forty-second Street the taxi swung
west to Seventh Avenue, south, passing Twenty-third
Street, west again through a maze of crooked old-time streets.
It stopped, finally, before a two-story and basement house of
red brick&mdash;one of many similar houses that lined both sides
of a dark and very silent block.</p>

<p>Annan got out, paid his fare, took the little satchel, and
handed Eris out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it a boarding house?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;One lodges well here,&#8221; he replied carelessly.</p>

<p>They ascended the stoop; Annan used his latch-key, let her
in, switched on the light.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come up,&#8221; he said briefly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>On the landing at the top of the stairs he switched on
another light, opened a door, lighted a third bracket.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come in!&#8221;</p>

<p>Eris entered the bed-room. It was large. So was the
bed, a four-poster. So was the furniture.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s your bath-room,&#8221; he remarked, opening a door
into a white-tiled room. He stepped inside to be certain.
There were plenty of towels, soap still in its wrapper, a row
of bottles with flowers painted on them&mdash;evidently for masculine
use&mdash;cologne, bay rum, witch hazel, hair-tonic.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; he said, &#8220;your worries are over until to-morrow.
There&#8217;s your tub, there&#8217;s your bed, there&#8217;s a key in the door.
Lock it when you turn in. And don&#8217;t you stir until they
bring your breakfast in the morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eris nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right. Good-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned toward him as though still a little bewildered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you going?&#8221; she asked timidly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Is there anything you need?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.... I would like to thank you&mdash;if you are going....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Little pilgrim,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I want to thank <i>you</i> for an
interesting evening.&#8221;</p>

<p>He held out his hand; Eris laid hers in it.</p>

<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t tell me your name,&#8221; he said smilingly,&mdash;&#8220;unless
you choose to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eris Odell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eris! Well, that&#8217;s rather classic, isn&#8217;t it? That&#8217;s an&mdash;unusual&mdash;name.... Eris.
Suggests Mount Ida and golden apples, doesn&#8217;t it?&mdash;Or
is it your stage name?&#8221;</p>

<p>Puzzled, smiling, he stood looking at her, still retaining
her hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s my name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, my name is Barry Annan.... And I
think it&#8217;s time we both got a little sleep....&#8221; He shook
her slender hand formally, released it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>&#8220;Good-night, Eris,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Lock your door and go to
sleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-night,&#8221; she replied in a tired, unsteady voice.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Annan walked through the corridor into the front bed-room
and turned on his light.</p>

<p>He seemed to be much amused with the situation,&mdash;a
little worried, too.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll get in Dutch if she doesn&#8217;t look out,&#8221; he thought as
he went about his preparations for the night.... &#8220;A
funny type.... Rather convincing.... Or a consummate
actress.... But she&#8217;s most amusing anyway. Let&#8217;s
see how she turns out.... She <i>looks</i> hungry.... What
a little fool!... Now, you couldn&#8217;t put this over on the
stage or in a story.... Your public is too wise. They
don&#8217;t grow that kind of girl these days.... That&#8217;s romantic
stuff and it won&#8217;t go with the wise guy.... You can&#8217;t
pull a character like this girl on any New York audience.
And yet, there she is&mdash;in there, scrubbing herself, if I can
judge by the sound of running water.... No, she doesn&#8217;t
exist.... And yet, there she is!... Only I&#8217;m too clever
to believe in her.... There is no fool like a smart
one.... That is why the Great American Ass is the greatest
ass on earth....&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">MRS. SNIFFEN, who had looked after Annan for
thirty years, found him bathed, shaved, and dressed,
and busy writing when she brought him his breakfast tray.</p>

<p>&#8220;The gentleman in the other room, Mr. Barry&mdash;when is
he to &#8217;ave &#8217;is breakfast?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a lady, old dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Sniffen&#8217;s pointed nose went up with a jerk. He had
been counting on that. He liked to see Mrs. Sniffen&#8217;s nose
jerk upward.</p>

<p>&#8220;A pretty lady,&#8221; he added, &#8220;with bobbed hair. I met her
accidentally about two o&#8217;clock this morning in Central Park.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the effect upon Mrs. Sniffen had sufficiently diverted
him, he told her very briefly the story of Eris.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m writing it now,&#8221; he added, grinning. &#8220;Sob-stuff,
Xantippe. I&#8217;m going to make a little gem of it. It&#8217;ll be a
heart-yanking tragedy&mdash;predestined woe from the beginning.
That&#8217;s what they want to-day,&mdash;weeps. So I&#8217;m going to
make &#8217;em snivel.... Moral stuff, old dear. You&#8217;ll like it.
Now, be nice to that girl in there when she wakes up&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He put his arm around Mrs. Sniffen&#8217;s starched and angular
shoulders as she indignantly placed his tray on the desk
before him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Leave me be, Mr. Barry,&#8221; she said sharply.</p>

<p>Some of the parties given by Annan had been attended by
what Mrs. Sniffen considered &#8220;hussies.&#8221; Annan gave various
sorts of parties. Some were approved by Mrs. Sniffen,
some she disapproved. Her sentiments made a chilling
difference in her demeanour, not in her efficiency. She was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
trained servant first of all. She had been in Annan&#8217;s family
for forty years.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be kind to her,&#8221; repeated Annan, giving Mrs. Sniffen a
pat and a hug. &#8220;She&#8217;s a good little girl.... Too good,
perhaps, to survive long. She&#8217;s the sort of girl you read
about in romance forty years ago. She&#8217;s a Drury Lane
victim. They were all fools, you know. I couldn&#8217;t leave the
suffering heroine of a Victorian novel out in the Park all
night, could I, old dear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s your &#8217;ouse, Mr. Barry,&#8221; said Mrs. Sniffen grimly.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t be trying to get around me with your imperent, easy
ways&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not trying to. When you see her and talk to her
you&#8217;ll agree with me that she is as virtuous as she is
beautiful. Of course,&#8221; he added, &#8220;virtue without beauty is
unknown in polite fiction, and is to be severely discouraged.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re the master,&#8221; snapped Mrs. Sniffen. &#8220;I know my
place. I &#8217;ope others will know theirs&mdash;particularly
minxes&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Xantippe, don&#8217;t freeze the child stiff. I&#8217;m very
sure she isn&#8217;t a minx&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Sniffen coldly laid down the law of suspects:</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>I&#8217;ll</i> know what she is when I see her.... There&#8217;s minxes
and there&#8217;s &#8217;ussies; and there&#8217;s sluts and scuts. And there&#8217;s
them that walk in silk and them that wear h&#8217;aprons. And
there&#8217;s them that would rather die where they lie than take
bed and bread of a strange young gentleman who follows
&#8217;is fancy for a lark on a &#8217;ot night in the Park. &#8217;Ussies
are &#8217;ussies. And I&#8217;m not to be deceived at my time o&#8217;
life.&#8221;</p>

<p>Annan chipped an egg, undisturbed. &#8220;I know you,
Xantippe,&#8221; he remarked. &#8220;You may not like some of the
people who come here, but you&#8217;ll be nice to this girl....
Take her breakfast to her at ten-thirty; look her over; come
in and report to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, sir.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>Annan went on with his breakfast, leisurely. As he ate
he read over his pencilled manuscript and corrected it between
bites of muffin and bacon.</p>

<p>It was laid out on the lines of those modern short stories
which had proven so popular and which had lifted Barry
Annan out of the uniform ranks of the unidentified and
given him an individual and approving audience for whatever
he chose to offer them.</p>

<p>Already there had been lively competition among periodical
publishers for the work of this new-comer.</p>

<p>His first volume of short stories was now in preparation.
Repetition had stencilled his name and his photograph upon
the public cerebrum. Success had not yet enraged the less
successful in the literary puddle. The frogs chanted politely
in praise of their own comrade.</p>

<p>The maiden, too, who sips the literary soup that seeps
through the pages of periodical publications, was already
requesting his autograph. Clipping agencies began to pursue
him; film companies wasted his time with glittering
offers that never materialised. Annan was on the way to
premature fame and fortune. And to the aftermath that
follows for all who win too easily and too soon.</p>

<p>There is a King Stork for all puddles. His law is the law
of compensations. Dame Nature executes it&mdash;alike on
species that swarm and on individuals that ripen too quickly.</p>

<p>Annan wrote very fast. There were about thirty-five
hundred words in the story of Eris. He finished it by
half-past ten.</p>

<p>Rereading it, he realised it had all the concentrated brilliancy
of an epigram. Whether or not it would hold water
did not bother him. The story of Eris was Barry Annan at
his easiest and most persuasive. There was the characteristic
and ungodly skill in it, the subtle partnership with a
mindless public that seduces to mental speculation; the reassuring
caress as reward for intellectual penetration; that
inborn cleverness that makes the reader see, applaud, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
pity him or herself in the sympathetic r&ocirc;le of a plaything
of Chance and Fate.</p>

<p>And always Barry Annan left the victim of his tact and
technique agreeably trapped, suffering gratefully, excited by
self-approval to the verge of sentimental tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;ll make &#8217;em ruffle their plumage and gulp down a
sob or two,&#8221; he reflected, his tongue in his cheek, a little
intoxicated, as usual, by his own infernal facility.</p>

<p>He lit a cigarette, shuffled his manuscript, numbered the
pages, and stuffed them into his pocket. The damned thing
was done.</p>

<p>Walking to the window he looked out into Governor&#8217;s
Place&mdash;one of those ancient and forgotten Greenwich streets,
and now very still and deserted in the intense July sunshine.</p>

<p>Already the hazy morning threatened to be hotter than
its humid predecessors. Nothing stirred in the street, not a
cat, not an iceman, not even a sparrow.</p>

<p>Tall old trees, catalpa, maple, ailanthus,&mdash;remnants of
those old-time double ranks that once lined both sidewalks,&mdash;spread
solitary pools of shade over flagstone and asphalt.
All else lay naked in the glare.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sniffen appeared, starched to the throat, crisp, unperspiring
in her calico.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s &#8217;ad her breakfast, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! How is she feeling?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Could you lend her a bath-robe and slippers, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>He smiled: &#8220;Has she concluded to stay here indefinitely?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Her clothes are in the tub, Mr. Barry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the bath-tub?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the laundry tub.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh. So you&#8217;re going to do her laundry for her!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no trouble, sir. I can &#8217;ave them for her by early
afternoon.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>&#8220;You&#8217;re a duck, Xantippe. You look after her. I&#8217;m
going down-town to the office. Give her some lunch.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very good, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>He followed Mrs. Sniffen to the corridor, where his straw
hat and malacca stick hung on a peg.</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I right, or is she a hussie?&#8221; he inquired, mischievously.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s an idjit,&#8221; snapped Mrs. Sniffen. &#8220;Spanking is
what she needs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You give her one,&#8221; he suggested in guarded tones, glancing
instinctively at the closed door beyond.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall you be back to lunch, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>He was descending the stairs, his story bulging in his coat
pocket.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; but don&#8217;t let her go till I come back. I&#8217;m going
to try to persuade her to go home to the pigs and cows....
And, Xantippe, there&#8217;ll be four to dinner. Eight o&#8217;clock
will be all right.... I&#8217;d like a few flowers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>Annan went out. The house had cooled during the
night and the heat in the street struck him in the face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hell,&#8221; he muttered, &#8220;isn&#8217;t there any end to this!&#8221;</p>

<p>There is no shabbier, dingier city in the world than New
York in midsummer.</p>

<p>The metropolis seems to be inhabited by a race constitutionally
untidy, indifferent to dirt, ignorant of beauty, of
the elements of civic pride and duty.</p>

<p>For health and comfort alone, tree-shaded streets are a
necessity; but in New York there is a strange hostility to
trees. The few that survive mutilation by vandals,&mdash;animal
and human,&mdash;are species that ought not to be planted
in such a city.</p>

<p>A few miserable elms, distorted poplars, crippled maples,
accentuate barren vistas. Lamp posts and fire boxes fill
up the iron void, stark as the blasted woods of no-man&#8217;s
land.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>Annan found Coltfoot, the Sunday editor, in his undershirt,
drops of sweat spangling the copy he was pencilling.</p>

<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t wait last night,&#8221; began Annan.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think I am!&#8221; growled Coltfoot &#8220;I need
sleep if you don&#8217;t.&#8221; He picked up a cold cigar, relighted it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do I get your ten or do you get mine?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s her story,&#8221; said Annan, tossing the manuscript
onto the desk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it straight?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, of course not. You yourself said that nothing really
ever happens except in the human brain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you hand me ten?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I found a news item and made a story of it. As the girl
is still alive, I had to end my story by deduction.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you do, kill her off?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You and your morgue,&#8221; grunted Coltfoot. &#8220;&mdash;it&#8217;s a
wonder your public stands for all the stiffs you bring
in.... But they do.... They want more, too. It&#8217;s a
murderous era. Fashion and taste have become necrological.
But mortuary pleasures pass. Happy endings and
bridal bells will come again. Then you tailors of Grubb
Street will have to cut your shrouds according.&#8221;</p>

<p>He glanced at the first pencilled page, skimmed it, read the
next sheet more slowly, lingered over the third&mdash;suddenly
slapped the manuscript with open palm:</p>

<p>&#8220;All right. All right! You get away with murder, as
usual.... Your stuff is dope. Anybody is an ass to try
it. It&#8217;s habit-forming stuff. I don&#8217;t know now whether
I owe you ten. I guess I do, don&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to wait and see what happens to her. If her
story works out like <i>my</i> version of her story, you&#8217;ll owe me
ten,&#8221; said Annan, laughing.</p>

<p>&#8220;What really happened last night after I left?&#8221; demanded
Coltfoot.</p>

<p>Annan told him, briefly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>&#8220;What,&#8221; exclaimed the other, &#8220;is that tramp girl still in
your house?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, poor little devil. I&#8217;m going to ship her back to her
native dairy this afternoon.... By the way, you&#8217;re dining
with me, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Coltfoot nodded, pushed a button and dragged a bunch of
copy toward him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get out of here,&#8221; he said.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Annan lunched at the Pewter Mug, a club for clever professionals,
where there were neither officers nor elections to
membership, nor initiation fees, nor vouchers to sign.</p>

<p>Nobody seemed to know how it originated, how it was
run, how members became members.</p>

<p>One paid cash for luncheon or dinner. The dues were
fifty dollars yearly, dumped into a locked box in cash.</p>

<p>Of course, some one man managed the Pewter Mug.
Several were suspected. But nobody in the large membership
was certain of his identity.</p>

<p>Thither strolled Barry Annan after a scorching trip uptown.
Wilted members drifted in to dawdle over cold
dishes,&mdash;clever youngsters who had made individual splashes
in their several puddles; professionals all,&mdash;players, writers,
painters, composers, architects, engineers, physicians, sailors,
soldiers,&mdash;the roll call represented all the creative and interpretive
professions that America is heir to.</p>

<p>Annan&#8217;s left-hand neighbour at the long table was a boy
officer whose a&euml;roplane had landed successfully on Pike&#8217;s
Peak, to the glory of the service and the star-spangled
banner.</p>

<p>On his right a young man named Bruce ate cold lobster
languidly. He was going to Newport to paint a great and
formidable lady&mdash;&#8220;gild the tiger-lily,&#8221; as Annan suggested,
to the horror of Mr. Bruce.</p>

<p>She had been a very great lady. Traditionally she was still
a social power. But she had seen everything, done everything,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
and now, grown old and bad-tempered, she passed
her declining days in making endless lists of people she did
not want to know.</p>

<p>She was Annan&#8217;s great-aunt. She had never forgiven
him for becoming a common public entertainer.</p>

<p>Once Annan wrote her: &#8220;I&#8217;ve a list of people you have
overlooked and whom you certainly would not wish to
know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Swallowing her dislike she wrote briefly requesting him
to send her the list.</p>

<p>He sent her the New York Directory. The breach was
complete.</p>

<p>&#8220;What can you offer me that I cannot offer myself?&#8221;
Annan had inquired impudently, at their final interview.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you come out of that Greenwich gutter and behave as
though you were not insane I can make you the most eligible
young man in New York,&#8221; she had replied.</p>

<p>He preferred his &#8220;gutter,&#8221; and she washed her gem-laden
hands of him.</p>

<p>But the curse clung to Barry Annan. &#8220;He&#8217;s a nephew
of Mrs. Magnelius Grandcourt,&#8221; was still remembered
against him when his name and his stories irritated the less
successful among his confr&egrave;res. The conclusion of the
envious was that he had a &#8220;pull.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bruce rose to go&mdash;a dark, sleek young man, trimmed in
Van Dyck fashion, with long, acquisitive fingers and something
in his suave manner that suggested perpetual effort to
please. But his eyes were opaque.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell my aunt,&#8221; said Annan, &#8220;that if she&#8217;ll behave herself
she can come and live a sporting life with me in Governor&#8217;s
Place, and bring her cat, parrot, and geranium.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bruce&#8217;s shocked features were Annan&#8217;s reward. He
grinned through the rest of luncheon; was still grinning
when he left the Pewter Mug.</p>

<p>Outside he met Coltfoot, hot and without appetite.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s ten degrees hotter down-town,&#8221; grunted the latter.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
&#8220;I&#8217;m empty, but the idea of food is repugnant. Where are
you going, Barry?&#8221;</p>

<p>Annan had forgotten Eris. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to get out of
town,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I think I&#8217;ll go out to Esperence and get
some golf. We can be back by 7:30. Does it appeal to
you, Mike?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It does, but I&#8217;m a business man, not a genius,&#8221; said
Coltfoot, sarcastically. &#8220;Did you ship your tramp girl
home?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Lord, I clean forgot her,&#8221; exclaimed Annan. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
got to go back to Governor&#8217;s Place. I must get rid of her
before dinner&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He was already moving toward Sixth Avenue. He turned
and called back, &#8220;Eight o&#8217;clock, Mike!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All set,&#8221; grunted Coltfoot.</p>

<p>An elevated train was Annan&#8217;s choice. Preoccupied with
the problem of Eris, he arrived at No. 3 Governor&#8217;s Place
before he had solved it. He didn&#8217;t want to hustle her out.
He couldn&#8217;t have her there at eight o&#8217;clock.</p>

<p>Letting himself into the little brick house with a latch-key,
he glanced along the corridor that led into the dining-room,
and saw Mrs. Sniffen in the butler&#8217;s pantry beyond.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, Xantippe,&#8221; he said; &#8220;how&#8217;s the minx?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Sniffen placed a cup of hot clam broth upon a
tray.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Barry,&#8221; she said in an oddly altered voice, &#8220;that
child is sick. She couldn&#8217;t keep her breakfast down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For heaven&#8217;s sake&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I made her some broth for luncheon. No use at all.
She couldn&#8217;t keep it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you suppose is the matter with her?&#8221; he demanded
nervously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Starvation. That&#8217;s my idea, sir. She&#8217;s that bony, Mr.
Barry&mdash;no flesh on &#8217;er except &#8217;er &#8217;ands and face,&mdash;and every
rib to be seen plain as my nose!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You think she hasn&#8217;t had enough to eat?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>&#8220;That, and the stuff she did eat&mdash;and what with walking
the streets in this &#8217;eat and sleeping out in the Park&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Sniffen hauled up the dumb-waiter and lifted off a
covered dish.</p>

<p>&#8220;Toasted biscuit,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;She can&#8217;t a-bear anything
&#8217;earty, Mr. Barry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, troubled, &#8220;what are we going to do with
her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s for you to say, sir. You brought &#8217;er &#8217;ere.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at Mrs. Sniffen and thought he detected a glimmer
of satisfaction at his predicament.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is she?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;In bed, sir. She wants to dress and go away but I
wouldn&#8217;t &#8217;ave it, Mr. Barry. Ambulance and &#8217;ospital&mdash;that&#8217;s
what would &#8217;appen next. And I &#8217;ad a time with her,
Mr. Barry. She said she was in the way and didn&#8217;t want
to give trouble. Hup she must get and h&#8217;off to the streets&mdash;But
I &#8217;ad &#8217;er clothes I did, soaking in my tubs.... I let &#8217;er
cry. I don&#8217;t say it &#8217;urt &#8217;er, either. It &#8217;elped, according
to my way of thinking.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She can&#8217;t go if she&#8217;s ill,&#8221; he said; and looked at Mrs.
Sniffen rather helplessly: &#8220;Do you think I&#8217;d better call in
a doctor?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir. I don&#8217;t mind looking out for her. A little
care is all she needs.&#8221;</p>

<p>After a moment&#8217;s frowning reflection: &#8220;It will be awkward
to-night,&#8221; he suggested.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sniffen&#8217;s nose went up: &#8220;The ladies will &#8217;ave to
powder their faces in your room, Mr. Barry, and keep their
&#8217;ands off the piano.&#8221;</p>

<p>He scowled at the prospect, then: &#8220;Here, give me that
tray. I&#8217;ll feed her myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went upstairs with the tray, knocked at the closed
door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tuck yourself in,&#8221; he called to her. &#8220;I&#8217;ve come to
nourish you. All set?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>After a few moments: &#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said calmly.</p>

<p>He went in. She sat huddled up in bed, swathed to
the throat in a blue crash bath-robe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&#8221;, he exclaimed gaily, &#8220;I hear unruly reports about
you. What do you mean by demanding to get up and
beat it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t expect you to keep me here, Mr. Annan. I&#8217;ve
been so much trouble already&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is clam broth. I think you can keep it down. Sip
it slowly. There are toasted crackers, too&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He placed the tray on her knees.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; he said, encouragingly, &#8220;be a sport!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try.&#8221;</p>

<p>The process of absorption was a slow one. She was very
pale, and there were dark smears under her eyes. Her
bobbed chestnut hair accented the slender purity of face and
neck. Her hands seemed plump, but the bath-robe sleeve
revealed a wrist and fore-arm much too thin.</p>

<p>&#8220;How does it feel?&#8221; he inquired, when the cup was empty.</p>

<p>Eris flushed. He saw that it embarrassed her to discuss
bodily ills with him. Memory of her morning sickness
deepened the painful tint in her cheeks:</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know&mdash;know what to say to you,&mdash;I am so
ashamed,&#8221; she faltered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eris!&#8221; he interrupted sharply.</p>

<p>She looked up, startled, her grey eyes brilliant with unshed
tears, and saw the boyish grin on his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;No weeps,&#8221; he said. &#8220;No apologies. It&#8217;s no trouble to
have you here. And here you remain, my gay and independent
little friend, until you&#8217;re fit to resume this disconcerting
career of yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel well enough to dress, if Mrs. Sniffen would give
me my clothes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where would you go?&#8221;</p>

<p>She made no reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look,&#8221; he said, laying a hundred-dollar bill on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
counterpane, &#8220;I did your story this morning. Here&#8217;s your
commission.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please&mdash;I can&#8217;t&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I shall tear up my story and hand back to the
<i>Planet</i> six hundred dollars that I need very badly.&#8221;</p>

<p>She gave him such a piteous look that he laughed.</p>

<p>That matter settled, he relieved her of the tray, set it outside,
and returned to seat himself in a rocking-chair beside
the bed.</p>

<p>&#8220;When they pull the galley proofs of your story, would
you like to read them, Eris?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, if I may.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not? It&#8217;s your story.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About&mdash;<i>me</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the story of Eris. I call it &#8216;The Gilded Apple.&#8217; It&#8217;s
sob-stuff. You begin to whimper after the first five hundred
words. Then it degenerates into a snivel, and finally
culminates in one heart-shattering sob.&#8221;</p>

<p>She had begun to understand his flippancy. And now her
smile glimmered responsive to his.</p>

<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s really about me,&#8221; she said, &#8220;why is the story
tragic?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I gave a tragic turn to our adventure,&#8221; he explained.</p>

<p>&#8220;How?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I made myself out a bad sort. That was the situation,&mdash;a
nice girl out o&#8217; luck, a rotter, a quick etching in of the Park
situation&mdash;then through remorseless logic I finish you in the
spotlight. You&#8217;re done for; but I drift away through darkness,
complacent, furtive, dangerous,&mdash;the bacteriological
symbol of cosmic corruption,&mdash;the Eternal Cad.&#8221;</p>

<p>From the first moment he had spoken to her in the Park
the night before, his every word had fascinated her.</p>

<p>Never before had she been in contact with that sort of
mind, with the vocabulary that was his, with words employed
as he employed them. The things this man did with words!</p>

<p>Not that she always understood them, or their intent, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
the true intent of the man who uttered them. But this man&#8217;s
speech had seemed, suddenly, to have awakened her from
sleep. And, awakened, everything he said vaguely excited
her.</p>

<p>Blind, unknown forces within her stirred when he spoke.
Her mind quivered in response; her very blood seemed stimulated.
It was as though, shrouding her mind, vast cloudy
curtains were opening to disclose undreamed of depths
darkly pulsating with veiled brilliancy. Out, into interstellar
space, lay the road to Truth.</p>

<p>She thought of her dream&mdash;of her wings. She lay looking
at Annan, waiting for words.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you look at me so oddly?&#8221; he asked, smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;I like what you say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>No man is proof against the surprise and pleasure of so
na&iuml;ve an avowal. Annan reddened, laughed, flattered and a
little touched by his power to please so easily.</p>

<p>Looking at her very amiably and complacently, he wondered
what effect he might have on this odd little pilgrim
if he chose to exert himself. He could be really eloquent
when he chose. It was good practice. It gave him facility
in his stories.</p>

<p>Considering her, now, a half-smile touching his lips, it
occurred to him that here, in her, he saw his audience in
the flesh. This was what his written words did to his readers.
His skill held their attention; his persuasive technique,
unsuspected, led them where he guided. His cleverness
meddled with their intellectual emotions. The more primitive
felt it physically, too.</p>

<p>When he dismissed them at the bottom of the last page
they went away about their myriad vocations. But his
brand was on their hearts. They were his&mdash;these countless
listeners whom he had never seen&mdash;never would see.</p>

<p>But he had spoken, and they were his&mdash;&mdash;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>He checked his agreeable revery. This wouldn&#8217;t do.
He was becoming smug. Reaction brought the inevitable
note of alarm. Suppose his audience tired of him. Suppose
he lost them. Chastened, he realised what his audience
meant to him,&mdash;these thousands of unknown people whose
minds he titivated, whose reason he juggled with, and whose
heart-strings he yanked, his tongue in his cheek.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eris,&#8221; he said with much modesty, &#8220;have you ever read
any of my stuff?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. May I?&#8221; she asked, shyly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you would. I&#8217;d like to know what you think of
it&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Always with her in his mind typifying the average
reader,&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;I&#8217;ll get you my last Sunday&#8217;s story&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He
jumped up and sped away like a boy eager to exhibit some
new treasure.</p>

<p>When he returned from his own room with the Sunday
edition, Eris was lying back on her pillows. Something
about the girl suddenly touched him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You poor little thing,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry you&#8217;re down
and out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her grey eyes regarded him with a sort of astonished
incredulity, as though unable to comprehend why he should
concern himself with so slight a creature as herself.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap2">ABOUT eight that evening Annan knocked and entered,
and found Eris intent on beef tea.</p>

<p>&#8220;How are you?&#8221; he asked in his winning, easy way, leaning
down to look at her, and to inspect the broth.</p>

<p>Her awe of him and his golden tongue made her diffident.
She tried now to respond to his light, informal kindness,&mdash;meet
it part way.</p>

<p>She said, shyly, that she was quite recovered,&mdash;sat embarrassed
under his amiable scrutiny, too bashful to continue
eating.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m having two or three people to dinner,&#8221; he remarked,
adjusting the camelia in his button-hole. &#8220;I hope we won&#8217;t
be noisy. If we keep you awake, pound on the floor.&#8221;</p>

<p>She thought that humorous. They both smiled. She
looked at the camelia in the lapel of his dinner jacket. He
leaned over and let her smell it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me,&#8221; he said with that caressing accent of personal
interest which in such men is merely normal affability, &#8220;do
you really begin to feel better?&#8221;</p>

<p>She flushed, thanked him in a troubled voice. Mustering
courage:</p>

<p>&#8220;I know I must be in the way here,&#8221; she ventured; &#8220;I
could get up and dress, if you&#8217;d let me, Mr. Annan&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dress? And go away?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go where?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You forget what you&#8217;ve given me. I have plenty of
money to take a room.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>&#8220;Do you mean that commission which brought me in five
hundred dollars?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You pretend it is that way.... Yes, I mean that
money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You funny child, I don&#8217;t want you to get up and dress.
You can&#8217;t go yet. You&#8217;re not in the way here.&#8221;</p>

<p>She said, solemn and tremulous: &#8220;I&#8217;ll never forget&mdash;your
kindness&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When you&#8217;re quite well again we&#8217;ll talk over things,&#8221;
he said cheerily. He was thinking that if she found him
so persuasive he&#8217;d have little trouble in starting her homeward.</p>

<p>The front doorbell rang. He got up, gave her arm a
friendly little pat.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll look in later,&#8221; he said, &#8220;if you&#8217;re still awake.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went away, lightly. She followed him with fathomless
grey eyes; listened to his steps descending the stairs&mdash;heard
his gay greeting, the voices of arriving guests&mdash;women&#8217;s
laughter&mdash;the deeper voice of another man. After
a little while she continued her interrupted dinner, gravely.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sniffen arrived presently. She seemed as starched,
as rigid, as angular and prim as ever. But there was no
disdainful tilt to her sharp nose. For the Mrs. Sniffen who
now approached Eris was not the chilling automaton who
had just admitted Annan&#8217;s dinner guests with priggish disapproval.</p>

<p>Eris, shy of her, looked up at her in some apprehension.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; exclaimed Mrs. Sniffen with a wintry smile, &#8220;you
<i>did</i> eat it all, didn&#8217;t you? That&#8217;s the way to grow &#8217;ealthy
<i>and</i> wealthy, not to say wise, isn&#8217;t it, now? &#8217;Ome vittles
&#8217;elps all &#8217;urts, big or little, to my way of thinking.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I enjoyed it so much, thank you,&#8221; murmured Eris.</p>

<p>&#8220;And glad I am to &#8217;ear you say it, Miss. &#8217;Ave you quite
finished?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, thank you very much.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Sniffen took the tray, hesitated by the bedside:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>&#8220;I &#8217;ope,&#8221; she said, &#8220;that you will soon be well, Miss....
New York is just as bad as London, every bit! I know them
both, Missy; and they&#8217;re both uncommon nasty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I like New York,&#8221; said Eris, shyly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sniffen&#8217;s nose went up with a jerk.</p>

<p>&#8220;And sorry I am to hear you say it,&#8221; she retorted severely.
&#8220;Them that has nice clean &#8217;omes in the nice clean countryside
don&#8217;t realise their blessings, according to my way of
thinking.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you ever live in the country?&#8221; ventured Eris.</p>

<p>&#8220;Turnham Green, Miss.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;London. It was all dirt and gin and barracks when I
was a kiddy. If I&#8217;d a pretty &#8217;ome in the nice clean countryside
like you, Miss, I&#8217;d be biding there yet, no doubt.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eris shook her bobbed head: &#8220;I <i>had</i> to come where I can
have a chance to learn something.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what, may I ask, Miss, would you learn &#8217;ereabouts?&#8221;
inquired Mrs. Sniffen with elaborate irony. &#8220;There&#8217;s little
to learn in New York that&#8217;s good for a body. It&#8217;s only a
big, &#8217;ot, dirty merry-go-round,&mdash;what with the outrageous
noise and crowds and hurry and scurry, and wild capers and
goings-on. No, Miss, you&#8217;ll learn nothing &#8217;elpful &#8217;ere, depend
upon it!&#8221;</p>

<p>Eris said, thoughtfully: &#8220;Only where are many people
gathered is there the foundation for a real education....
Good and evil <i>are</i>.... Only truth matters. The important
thing is to know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who told you that?&#8221; demanded Mrs. Sniffen, amazed
to hear such authoritative language.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nobody. But I&#8217;m quite sure it&#8217;s so. Books alone do
not educate. They are like roughage for cattle. There is no
nourishment in them but they help to digest Truth. I wish
to see and hear for myself, and learn to understand in my
own way.... What <i>my</i> eyes and ears tell me is what I
ought to think about and try to understand. And I believe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
this is more important than reading in books what other
people think of what <i>they</i> have seen and heard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;God bless her baby-face!&#8221; exclaimed Mrs. Sniffen, exasperated.
&#8220;Where does a kiddy find such notions, and the
outlandish words for them, now? What are young folk
coming to, any&#8217;ow, gypsying about the world as they please
these crazy days? It&#8217;s a bad world, Missy, and the worst
of it settles in big cities like rancid grease in a sink....
Not that I&#8217;m the kind to push <i>my</i> nose into others&#8217; business.
I know better. No, Miss, I&#8217;ve troubles enough to
mind of my own, I &#8217;ave. But when I see a polite and well
mannered young person turn her back on &#8217;ealth and &#8217;ome
to come to a nasty, rotten place like New York and sleep in
the public parks at that, &#8217;ow can I &#8217;elp expressing my opinion?
I <i>can&#8217;t</i> &#8217;elp expressing it. I&#8217;m bound to say you ought
to go &#8217;ome; and it would be a shame to me all my days if I
&#8217;adn&#8217;t spoken!&#8221;</p>

<p>She seemed to be in a temper. She marched out with her
tray, her starched skirts bristling, her nose high. Opening
the door, she looked back wrathfully at Eris, hesitated, door-knob
gripped:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll &#8217;ave some chicken for you before you sleep,&#8221; she
snapped; and closed the door with a distinct bang.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Downstairs, Annan had entertained three friends at
dinner&mdash;Coltfoot, Rosalind Shore, and Betsy Blythe.</p>

<p>Of the making of moving pictures there is no end&mdash;until
the sheriff enters. And Miss Blythe helped make as many
pictures as her rather brief career had, so far, permitted.</p>

<p>She was to have her own company now. The people
interested finally had &#8220;come across&#8221;; Betsy talked volubly
at dinner. Gaiety, excitement and congratulations reigned
and rained.</p>

<p>Rosalind Shore, another stellar d&eacute;butante, already in her
first season, had won her place in musical comedy. She
was one of those dark-eyed, white-skinned, plumply graceful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
girls, very lazy but saturated with talent. Which, however,
would have meant little beyond the chorus unless her
mother, an ex-professional, had literally clubbed musical and
dramatic education into her.</p>

<p>Indolent, but immensely clever, little Miss Shore&#8217;s girlhood
had been one endless hell of maternal maulings. She
was whipped if she neglected voice and piano; beaten if she
shirked dramatic drill; kicked into dancing school, and
spanked if she loitered late away from home. Yet she&#8217;d
never have been anybody otherwise.</p>

<p>She had Jewish blood in her. She was distractingly
pretty.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mom&#8217;s a terror,&#8221; she used to remark, reflectively. &#8220;She
thumped me till I saw so many stars that I turned into
one.&#8221;</p>

<p>She sang the lead in &#8220;The Girl from Jersey&#8221;&mdash;into which
a vigorous kick from her mother had landed her, to puzzle a
public which never before had heard of Rosalind Shore.</p>

<p>The show ran until July and was to resume in September.</p>

<p>The girlhood of Bettina&mdash;or Betsy&mdash;Blythe, had been
very different. She was one of a swiftly increasing number
of well-born girls whom society had welcomed as
d&eacute;butantes, and who, after a first season, and great amateur
success in the Junior League, had calmly informed her
family that she had made a contract with some celluloid
corporation to appear in moving pictures.</p>

<p>New York society was becoming accustomed to this sort
of behaviour. It had to be. From the time that the nation&#8217;s
war-bugles sounded assembly at Armageddon, the
younger generation had taken the bit between its firm teeth.
Nothing had yet checked them. They still were running
away.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In Annan&#8217;s little drawing-room, where coffee had been
served, the excited chatter continued to turn around Betsy&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
brand new company,&mdash;this event being the reason for the
dinner.</p>

<p>Every capitalist involved was discussed, and pulled to
quivering pieces; every officer and director in the <i>Betsy
Blythe Company, Inc.</i> was dissected under the merciless
scrutiny of four young people who already had learned in
New York to believe only what happened, and to turn deaf
ears to mere words.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen, Betsy,&#8221; said Rosalind Shore, &#8220;Mom says you&#8217;re
all right with Cairo Cotton and Levant Tobacco behind
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The main thing,&#8221; remarked Coltfoot, &#8220;is to begin in a
businesslike way. Don&#8217;t start off staggering under a load
of overheads, Betsy. Don&#8217;t let them take expensive offices.
The people who&#8217;ll use &#8217;em would have to sit in a Mills Hotel
if you didn&#8217;t provide a loafing place for them.</p>

<p>&#8220;And don&#8217;t spill money down the coal hole for a plant.
When you need a studio, hire it for the length of time you
expect to use it. Hire everything. Spend your money on
the people who&#8217;ll bring it back to you, not on human objects
d&#8217;art and period furniture.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; said Betsy, &#8220;but I can&#8217;t control those things,
can I?&#8221;</p>

<p>Annan said: &#8220;Perhaps you can. You know, socially,
some of the people who are putting up the money. Harry
Sneyd has to account to them. He&#8217;s handling you and you
can handle him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can see to it,&#8221; said Coltfoot, &#8220;that Levant Tobacco
isn&#8217;t used to pension a bunch of bums and dumb-bells. You
can see to it that the money is spent where it ought to be
spent. Your people have got real money. You can&#8217;t buy
a good story for nothing; you can&#8217;t buy a good director or
a good camera-man for nothing. Those are the people to
pay.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rosalind nodded: &#8220;And low pedal on art-directors and
carpenters,&#8221; she added. &#8220;I&#8217;m not so sure that I need all I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
get. Scenery is on the toboggan, sister Bettina. You don&#8217;t
want expensive sets. Neither does your audience. It wants
you. And it wants your story. So don&#8217;t let your bunch
start rebuilding devastated France in your back yard when
a corner in a hall bed-room will do.... It will always do
if the story and the acting go over. I don&#8217;t have to tell
you that, either.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No interior ever made a picture,&#8221; agreed Annan, &#8220;and
no exterior ever saved one. But I&#8217;d go as far as I liked
on the scenery that you don&#8217;t have to pay God for.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Blythe laughed: &#8220;Are you going to do a story for
me, Barry?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;You promised&mdash;when you were
in love with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am yet. But your people don&#8217;t like sob-stuff any better
than does Rosalind&#8217;s audience.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to squirt tears into every story you
write,&#8221; retorted Betsy. &#8220;Did you ever see me cry? There
are people, Barry, who manage to get on without snivelling
every minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never cry,&#8221; remarked Rosalind; &#8220;Mom spanked the
last tear out of me years ago.&#8221; She rose and moved
indolently to the piano.</p>

<p>Few professional pianists were better at her age,&mdash;thanks
to &#8220;Mom,&#8221; who had been a celebrated one.</p>

<p>Rosalind talked and idled at the keys, played, chattered,
sang enchantingly, killed loveliness with a jest, slew beauty
to light a cigarette, cursed with caprice the charming theme
developing or, capriciously and tenderly protected, nourished
and cared for it until it grew to exquisitive maturity. Then
strangled it with a &#8220;rag.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You little devil,&#8221; said Betsy, tremulous under the spell&mdash;&#8220;I
wouldn&#8217;t strangle my own offspring as you do!&mdash;I
<i>couldn&#8217;t</i>&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Emotion checked her.</p>

<p>Rosalind laughed: &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter when one can have
all the offspring one wants.... You&#8217;ll never get on if
you&#8217;re too serious, Bettina mia.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>&#8220;That&#8217;s your friend Barry talking, not <i>you</i>,&#8221; retorted
Betsy. &#8220;<i>He</i> can get away with it&mdash;sitting all alone in a
stuffy room where his readers can&#8217;t see him writing sob-stuff
with his tongue in his cheek. But you and I had better
wear faces that can be safely watched, my Rosalinda child!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to ask you,&#8221; said Rosalind, turning to Annan,
&#8220;whether an audience can surmise what sort of private
life one leads merely from watching one on the stage or
screen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think so, in a measure,&#8221; he replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then it does pay to behave,&#8221; concluded Betsy, walking
to a mirror to inspect herself. &#8220;Not guilty&mdash;so far,&#8221; she
added, powdering her nose; &#8220;&mdash;am I, Barry?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Old Jule C&aelig;sar&#8217;s wife was a schmeer in comparison,&#8221;
he agreed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you, young man,&#8221; she remarked, &#8220;I&#8217;ve found the
Broadway atmosphere healthier than it is in some New York
younger sets.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that one answer to why do young men haunt stage
doors?&#8221; inquired Coltfoot.</p>

<p>&#8220;You miserable cynic,&#8221; retorted Betsy, &#8220;the sort of young
man who does that belongs in the sets I mentioned.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anyway,&#8221; added Rosalind, with lazy humour, &#8220;you and
Barry are spending a perfectly good evening as close to the
stage as you can get. Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; added Betsy, &#8220;do men prefer women of the
stage?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good God,&#8221; said Coltfoot, &#8220;take any Sunday supplement
and compare the faces of Newport and Broadway. That&#8217;s
one reason out of hundreds.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Few men chase a face that makes them ache,&#8221; added
Barry, &#8220;even if the atmosphere in some sets smells of the
stage door.... Tell me, beautiful Betsy, why you don&#8217;t
canter about very much in your own gold-plated and exclusive
social corral?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; she replied tranquilly, &#8220;I have a better time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
with the people I meet professionally ... mavericks from
the gold-plated corral like you, for instance. You and Mike
and Rosalind are more amusing than Sally Snitface or
Percy Pinhead. And you&#8217;re far more moral.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder if I am moral,&#8221; mused Rosalind, shaking the
cracked ice in her glass.</p>

<p>&#8220;God, your mother and your native laziness incline you
that way,&#8221; said Barry, gravely. &#8220;You&#8217;re better than good;
you&#8217;re apathetic. Inertia will see you through.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It takes energy to be a devil,&#8221; added Coltfoot. &#8220;Your
perfect angel snoozes on a cloud. She&#8217;s too lazy to walk.
That&#8217;s why she grew wings and why you take taxi-cabs,
Rosalind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do. I use my legs sufficiently on the stage, thank
you. Also, I admit I like to snooze.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Angel,&#8221; said Betsy from the mirror, &#8220;lend me your lipstick.&#8221;
And, to Annan: &#8220;May I ascend to the rear room
and make up properly?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, go into my room.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But there&#8217;s no dressing table there&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; starting to
go.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t go up there,&#8221; he repeated. &#8220;I mean it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl turned: &#8220;Oh, is there a lady there?&#8221; she asked
with that flippant freedom fashionable in certain sets, but
mostly due to ignorance.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is,&#8221; said Annan, coolly.</p>

<p>Rosalind did not believe it, but she said carelessly:
&#8220;That&#8217;s rather disgusting if it&#8217;s true.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s true,&#8221; said Coltfoot. He sketched the story. Rosalind,
who had been sagging picturesquely, sat up straight.
Betsy listened incredulously at first, then with knitted brows.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean to ship her back to the old farm,&#8221; added Annan.
&#8220;She needs a wet-nurse&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to see her,&#8221; said Miss Blythe abruptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, she isn&#8217;t on exhibition,&#8221; returned Annan in a dry
voice.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>&#8220;Can&#8217;t I see her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Put yourself in her place. Would <i>you</i> feel comfortable,
lying in the guest bed of a strange man? And would <i>you</i>
care to have a fashionably gowned girl come flying in to
stare at you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Betsy gazed at him scarcely listening. She turned to
Rosalind:</p>

<p>&#8220;If she&#8217;s got as much nerve as that, couldn&#8217;t you or I do
something?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; nodded Rosalind.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better let her go home,&#8221; said Annan. &#8220;She has
pluck and perhaps talent, but she hasn&#8217;t the sense to
take care of herself. You let her alone, Bet, do you
hear?&#8221;</p>

<p>Betsy&#8217;s nose went up. &#8220;Mind your business, Barry. If
she works for me she needn&#8217;t worry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better take her on, then,&#8221; said Rosalind. &#8220;Mom
bangs me around so that I&#8217;m too groggy to look out for
anybody&#8217;s morals except my own.&#8221;</p>

<p>Betsy came up to Annan and put her hands on his
shoulders:</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me see her; I shan&#8217;t eat her. I might use her. She&#8217;s
a sandy kid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s twenty. She told me so,&#8221; he retorted.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s cruel to ship her back to the cows, Barry, when she&#8217;s
gone through such a rotten novitiate. I think you&#8217;re taking
a great responsibility if you use that easy and persuasive
tongue of yours to send her back to the stupidity she ran
away from. Don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Rosalind said to her: &#8220;There&#8217;s no point in your pawing
Barry Annan. I&#8217;ve done it. He lets you. Then he does
what he pleases.&#8221;</p>

<p>Annan grinned faintly: Betsy suddenly slapped his face,
not hard.</p>

<p>&#8220;That complacent smirk!&#8221; she said, exasperated.</p>

<p>Before Annan guessed what she was about, she turned and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
ran upstairs. He followed, too late. The guest-room door
opened and slammed, and he heard the key turn inside.</p>

<p>He returned to the drawing-room, laughing but irritated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Little meddlesome devil,&#8221; he said, &#8220;talking to <i>me</i> of
responsibility! Here&#8217;s where I wash my hands of the Eris
kid. It&#8217;s Betsy&#8217;s deal now.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was.</p>

<p>Eris, listening to the laughter and music below, lying
wide-eyed on her pillow, sat up startled and wider yet of
eye when a scurry and flurry of scented skirts, followed by
the clash of a swiftly locked door landed Betsy Blythe at
her bedside.</p>

<p>She stared at the breathless vision of flushed beauty, too
astounded to think of herself and her position.</p>

<p>Down on the bed&#8217;s edge dropped Miss Blythe, radiant,
cheeks and eyes still brilliant from her victory.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m Betsy Blythe,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I heard about you. How
fine and plucky of you! What a perfectly rotten experience!...
Tell me your name, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eris Odell,&#8221; said the girl mechanically, still under the
spell of this sudden brightness which seemed to fill the
whole room with rose colour.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear,&#8221; said Betsy, &#8220;please forgive me for coming
in on my head. Mr. Annan tried to prevent me. You
mustn&#8217;t blame him. But when I heard how plucky you are
I simply had to come up and tell you that I&#8217;m going to ask
my manager to take you on. I haven&#8217;t seen our first script.
They&#8217;re doing the continuity now. But I&#8217;m sure there must
be something&mdash;something, at least, to start you going&mdash;so
you won&#8217;t need to sleep in the park&mdash;you poor child&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She impulsively caressed one of the hands that lay on
the quilt; retained it, looking at Eris with increasing interest
and kindness. Suddenly, for one fleeting moment, the subtle
warning that a pretty woman feels in discovering greater
beauty in another, touched Betsy Blythe. And passed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;m in pictures,&#8221; she said, smilingly. &#8220;I should have told
you that first. I have my own company now. When you
are quite recovered, will you come and see me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, thank you.&#8221; The eyes of Eris were great wells of
limpid grey; her lips, a trifle apart, burned deep scarlet.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are <i>so</i> pretty,&#8221; said Betsy,&mdash;&#8220;do you test well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They thought so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Crystal Film people?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have Mr. Sneyd give you another test. He&#8217;ll make
you up. Or I will. You know, of course, that it won&#8217;t be a
part that amounts to anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it will be a part. We&#8217;ll carry you&mdash;not like an extra,
you see&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Betsy rose, went over to a little desk, wrote
her address and brought it to Eris.</p>

<p>&#8220;You do forgive me for coming in to see you this crazy
way, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes&mdash;yes, I do&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Suddenly the grey eyes flashed
tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;You sweet child!&#8221; said Betsy Blythe, stooping over her.
&#8220;You&#8217;re nice. A woman can tell, no matter what a pig of a
man might think. I like you, Eris. I <i>want</i> you to get on.
I&#8217;d love to have you make good some day.&#8221; She added
na&iuml;vely: &#8220;&mdash;If only to put Barry Annan&#8217;s nose out of
joint.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eris had covered her wet lashes with her fore-arm. Now
she removed it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Annan has been wonderful,&#8221; she said in a tear-congested
voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Three cheers!&#8221; said Betsy, laughing. &#8220;You&#8217;re a loyal
youngster, aren&#8217;t you? Everybody likes Barry Annan.
Several love him. But <i>you</i> mustn&#8217;t,&#8221; she added with a
gravity that deceived Eris.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; she said hurriedly, &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t think of such a
thing.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>At that Betsy&#8217;s clear laughter rang out in the room. Eris
blushed furiously; then, suddenly and swiftly <i>en rapport</i>,
laughed too.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s so nice and so spoiled,&#8221; said Betsy. &#8220;That bland
grin of his!&mdash;and he <i>is</i> clever&mdash;oh, very. He knows how to
make your heart jump when he writes. In private character
he&#8217;s kind but mischievous. He&#8217;ll experiment with a
girl if she&#8217;ll let him. It interests him to try cause and effect
on us. Don&#8217;t <i>you</i> let him. He has that terrible talent for
swift intimacy. That caressing courtesy, that engaging and
direct interest he seems to take in whoever he is with, means
no more than a natural and kindly consideration for everybody.
It misleads some women. I don&#8217;t mean <i>he</i> does, intentionally.
Only any man, seeing a pretty girl inclined to
be flattered, is likely to investigate further. I don&#8217;t blame
him. We do it, too, don&#8217;t we?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never did,&#8221; said Eris na&iuml;vely.</p>

<p>Betsy&#8217;s smile faded and she gave Eris a sharp look. Then,
abruptly, she took both her hands and sat regarding
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you something,&#8221; she concluded, finally. &#8220;Men
won&#8217;t fool you: you&#8217;ll fool them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shan&#8217;t try to,&#8221; said Eris.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s how you&#8217;ll do it.... You&#8217;re unusual; do you
realize it? What is it that interests you most?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to learn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought so. I&#8217;ve known one or two girls like you.
Pretty ones.... Almost as pretty as you, Eris. They
raise the devil with men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How?&#8221; asked Eris, astonished.</p>

<p>&#8220;Merely by being what they are,&mdash;absolutely normal under
all conditions. Men are completely fooled. To a man,
feminine youth and beauty mean a depthless capacity for
sex sentiment. My dear, you have very little of that sort....
Or, if you have any, it&#8217;s the normal amount and is
reserved for the great moment in life.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>&#8220;What is the great moment in life?&#8221; asked Eris.</p>

<p>&#8220;Love, I suppose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not think I shall have time for it,&#8221; said Eris,
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good heavens!&#8221; exclaimed Betsy, laughing. &#8220;Don&#8217;t be
unhuman!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no.... I only mean that it&#8217;s&mdash;it&#8217;s a thing which
has not&mdash;occurred.... I have not thought about it, much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor wished for it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Still,&#8221; said Betsy, smiling, &#8220;we&#8217;re made for it, you know....
That is, if we&#8217;re quite healthy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose so,&#8221; said Eris absently.</p>

<p>After a silence Betsy pressed her hands, rose, looked
down at her with friendly gaze.</p>

<p>&#8220;I ought to join the others. You won&#8217;t forget to come?
Please don&#8217;t: I&#8217;d like to have you with us. Good-night,
Eris. Get well quickly!&#8221;</p>

<p>As she was going out: &#8220;Make my peace with Barry Annan,&#8221;
she added. &#8220;I&#8217;m in dutch with that young man.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The slangy girl really was not. Annan, at the piano,
pounding out a rag while Rosalind and Coltfoot danced,
merely called out to her that the responsibility for Eris Odell
was hers from that moment and if they ever found the girl
in the river it was none of his doings.</p>

<p>Betsy smiled scornfully: &#8220;I&#8217;d trust that girl anywhere,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;Some day a girl like Eris will teach you a few
new steps in the merry dance of life, Barry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What new steps?&#8221; He continued playing but looked
curiously up at Betsy, who had come over beside him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re so cocksure of yourself,&#8221; she said, &#8220;aren&#8217;t you,
dear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean I&#8217;m a prig?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, just a very clever, good-looking boy with kind instincts
and a fatal facility. You think you&#8217;re real. You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
think you write realisms. You&#8217;ll come up against the real
thing some day. <i>Then</i>&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, go on!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; she said, smiling at him, &#8220;then you&#8217;ll bump your
complacent head, my dear. <i>That</i> will be reality. And maybe
you&#8217;ll know it again when you run into it. Maybe it will
rid you of that bland grin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a melting smile, not a grin, darling,&#8221;&mdash;pounding
away vigorously. &#8220;But tell me about this &#8216;real thing&#8217; that
I&#8217;m to crack my noodle on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A girl, ducky.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure. I&#8217;m cracked already on &#8217;em all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The one I mean is named Nemesis and she&#8217;ll knock your
silly head off.... Like that child upstairs, for example.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s got a Greek name, too. I&#8217;d better remember to
&#8216;fear the Greeks&#8217;&mdash;yes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Little Eris could double <i>you</i> up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wh-at?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mean Eris in particular, dear friend. But one
of her species.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s her species?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You, a writer!&mdash;and you haven&#8217;t even doped her out!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have, however,&#8221; he contradicted her tranquilly.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right. Analyse her for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quantitatively?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here she is then: clean, plucky, uneducated, obstinate,
immature; and, like any other girl, perfectly pliable when
properly handled by an expert.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>You?</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I wouldn&#8217;t say that, tweetums&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to say it. But I&#8217;m glad you think you&#8217;re
an expert. For it&#8217;s going to be <i>that</i> kind of girl who will
some day put a crimp in you, Barry, and teach you what
you don&#8217;t know anything about.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that, Rose of my Harem?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>&#8220;Women,&#8221; she said maliciously, &#8220;and you make a living
by writing about them. And the Great American Ass believes
you know what you&#8217;re writing about!&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Coltfoot telephoned for his car after midnight and drove
Annan&#8217;s fair guests homeward.</p>

<p>Annan, born with a detestation for sleep, locked up and
put out the lights unwillingly.</p>

<p>As he passed Eris&#8217; door on his way to his room, he halted
a moment, listening.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you awake, Eris?&#8221; he asked in a modulated voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s fine!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;May I come in for a moment?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, please.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her light was on. She was sitting up in bed. When he
caught the first glimpse of the radiant face, flushed with
happy excitement, he scarcely recognised the pinched and
pallid girl of the park. In his astonishment he thought her
the prettiest thing he remembered ever seeing; stood silent,
quite overwhelmed by the unfamiliar beauty of the girl.</p>

<p>Entirely unconscious of admiration, she smiled enchantingly&mdash;a
piquant and really charming picture in her bath-robe
and bobbed hair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you so much,&#8221; she said, &#8220;for asking Miss Blythe
to see me. She pretended you wouldn&#8217;t let her come, but I
knew she was joking. Miss Blythe asked me to join her own
company. I simply can&#8217;t sleep for thinking of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He came over to the bedside and took a chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eris,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I really didn&#8217;t want Miss Blythe to see
you. I thought you ought to go home when you recover.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at him, startled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe I&#8217;m wrong,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but I think so, still.&#8221;</p>

<p>After a silence: &#8220;You <i>are</i> wrong.... But I know you
mean it kindly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hang it all, of course I do. You&#8217;re an unusual girl&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
Betsy&#8217;s words, she remembered&mdash;&#8220;and you interest me; and I
like you.... And I know something about Broadway....
It worries me a little&mdash;the combination of you and
Broadway.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;worry <i>you</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In a way.... Your inexperience.... And you don&#8217;t
know men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t know men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;there you are,&#8221; he said, impatiently.</p>

<p>Yes, there she was,&mdash;in the guest-room bed of one of
them.</p>

<p>She said, tranquilly: &#8220;It is kind of you to be interested in
me. I feel it deeply, Mr. Annan. It seems wonderful to me,
that a man so&mdash;a man like yourself&mdash;should have&mdash;have
time to care what happens to a perfectly strange nobody....
But I <i>can&#8217;t</i> go home.... Not yet.... I shouldn&#8217;t
care to live if I can&#8217;t have an opportunity to learn.... So&mdash;so
that&#8217;s <i>that</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>He, finally, laughed. &#8220;Is it, Eris?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said, smiling at him, &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And that&#8217;s <i>that</i>,&#8221; he concluded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, really it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right.&#8221; He got up, stood fumbling with a cigarette.
&#8220;All right, Eris. If &#8216;<i>that&#8217;s</i>&#8217; the verdict, I guess I was wrong.
I guess you know your business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. But I hope to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You fascinatingly literal kid!&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He burst out laughing,
went over and shook hands with her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Somebody else will have to milk the cows and feed the
chickens. That&#8217;s plain as the permanent curls on your
bobbed head, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said, laughing, &#8220;&mdash;and you&#8217;re so funny!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m a great wit,&#8221; he admitted. &#8220;Well, little pilgrim,
you require sleep if I don&#8217;t.... I think I&#8217;ll go in and start
a story.... Or read.... <i>Your</i> story is just beginning,
isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>She ventured a timid jest: &#8220;<i>You</i> finished my story for
me, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did. When it&#8217;s published, and you read it, you&#8217;ll
never stop guying me, I suppose.&#8221;</p>

<p>She still ventured pleasantries: &#8220;So you didn&#8217;t tell how I
left the Park and walked straight into an engagement, did
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear, I bumped you off to sneak-music. It goes, you
know, with my clients. They wouldn&#8217;t stand for what Miss
Blythe did. Neither would the <i>Planet</i>. I&#8217;d get the hook.&#8221;</p>

<p>They both were laughing when he said good-night.</p>

<p>He went into his room but did not light the lamp. For a
long while he sat by the open window looking out into the
darkness of Governor&#8217;s Place.</p>

<p>It probably was nothing he saw out there that brought to
his lips a slight, recurrent smile.</p>

<p>The bad habit of working late at night was growing on
this young man. It is a picturesque habit, and one of the
most imbecile, because sound work is done only with a normal
mind.</p>

<p>He made himself some coffee. A rush of genius to the
head followed stimulation. He had a grand time, revelling
with pen and pad and littering the floor with inked sheets
unnumbered and still wet. His was a messy genius. His
plot-logic held by the grace of God and a hair-line. Even
the Leaning Tower of Pisa can be plumbed; and the lead
dangled inside Achilles&#8217; tendon when one held the string
to the medulla of Annan&#8217;s stories.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>He rose at his usual early hour, rather pallid, and parched
by too many pipes.</p>

<p>When he left the house for down-town, Mrs. Sniffen reported
Eris still sound asleep. So Annan went away to
deposit seven thousand words with Coltfoot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Off the bat just like that,&#8221; he said, tossing the untidy
bundle onto Coltfoot&#8217;s desk.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>&#8220;You mean that you did this story last night after we
left?&#8221; demanded Coltfoot.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I do, Mike,&mdash;sometimes. And sometimes
I&#8217;m two or three weeks on this sort of thing. I think I&#8217;ll
go back and do another. I feel like it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Probably,&#8221; remarked the other, &#8220;this is punk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Probably not,&#8221; said Annan serenely. &#8220;Are you lunching?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Probably not if I read this bunk first. Is it really up to
your worst level?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your readers will wail like a bunch of banshees over it.
It&#8217;s dingy, squalid, photographic. What more does the
Great American Ass require?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s his fodder,&#8221; admitted Coltfoot. &#8220;Now g&#8217;wan
outa here, you licensed push-cart bandit!... By the way,
how&#8217;s the park-bencher this morning?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Asleep when I left the house.&#8221; He seated himself
sideways on Coltfoot&#8217;s desk:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mike, do you know she&#8217;s exceedingly pretty?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How should I know?... But trust you to pick that
kind&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I forgot that you&#8217;ve never seen her. Well, last night
after you left I stopped to look in on her, and, honestly, her
beauty startled me. She&#8217;s beautiful thick chestnut hair and
fine grey eyes, and the loveliest mouth&mdash;its expression is
charming!&mdash;and really, Mike, her arms and hands are delicate
enough for a Psyche. Maybe she milked and fed
ducks, but I can&#8217;t see any of the hick about her&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He smiled, made one of his characteristic, graceful gestures:
&#8220;It&#8217;s funny, but there she is. And yet, I&#8217;d not venture
to use her in a story &#8216;as is.&#8217; Because my wise guys
wouldn&#8217;t believe in her. I&#8217;d be damned as a romanticist.
And you&#8217;d chuck me out of the Sunday Edition.&#8221;</p>

<p>Coltfoot sat gazing up at him for a few moments,
then put on his reading-spectacles and pawed at a wad of
proof.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to chuck you out of this office anyway,&#8221; he
grunted.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Exactly why Annan chose to lunch at home did not occur
to him until, arriving there, Mrs. Sniffen handed him a note
and announced the departure of Eris Odell.</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; he said irritably, &#8220;has she gone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About eleven, Mr. Barry. And would you believe that
child would ask me to take five dollars for making her bed?
And she with scarce a penny. What&#8217;s one &#8217;undred and
twenty dollars in New York? I could ha&#8217; birched her&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Give me the note,&#8221; he interrupted, disappointed. Because
that was why he had come home to lunch,&mdash;to see this
youngster who had so ungratefully and rudely departed.</p>

<p>He went upstairs to his room, seated himself, slit the
envelope with a paper cutter, and leisurely but sulkily unfolded
the sheet of note paper within.</p>

<p>A hundred-dollar bank note fell to the floor.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;Dear Friend,&#8221; he read,&mdash;a rural form of address that
always annoyed Annan,&mdash;&#8220;please do not be offended if I
leave without awaiting your return. Because I feel keenly
that I ought not to impose upon your great kindness any
longer.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am at a loss to express my gratitude. Your goodness
has stirred my deepest sensibilities and has imprinted upon
my innermost mind a sense of obligation never to be forgotten.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall always marvel that so well known and successful
a man could find time to trouble himself with the personal
embarrassment of an insignificant stranger.</p>

<p>&#8220;What you have done for me is so wonderful that I can
only feel it but cannot formulate my feeling in words.</p>

<p>&#8220;And thank you for the hundred dollars. But please,
<i>please</i> understand that I could not keep it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Confident in the promise of Miss Blythe, I shall venture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
to take the room that sometimes I have taken for a single
night. It is at 696 Jane Street.</p>

<p>&#8220;So good-bye&mdash;unless you ever would care to see me
again&mdash;and thank you with a heart very full, dear Mr.
Annan.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">&#8220;Yours sincerely,</span><br />

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap2">ANNAN had every intention of going to Jane Street.
But Barry Annan was that kind of busy man who takes
the most convenient diversion in the interims of work.</p>

<p>He wrote a note to Eris, promising to stop in very soon;
but week-ends interfered. Then, in August, a house party
at Southampton, another in Saratoga for the races, and the
remaining two weeks trout fishing in the Maine forests, convicted
him as the sort of social liar everybody understands.</p>

<p>But Eris was not anybody yet. She did not understand.
There was not a single evening she had not waited for him,
not daring to go out lest she miss him.</p>

<p>Only when the Betsy Blythe Company departed on location
did Eris abandon hope and pack her little satchel for the
Harlem &amp; Westchester train.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Annan, at Portage Camps, had a letter from Betsy Blythe
on location, dated from Cross River in Westchester.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;Our first picture is called &#8216;The Real Thing,&#8217;&#8221; she wrote,
&#8220;and we&#8217;re shooting all our exteriors while the foliage lasts.
This is a wonderful spot for that&mdash;everything within a mile&mdash;and
perfect weather.</p>

<p>&#8220;Frank Donnell is my director&mdash;a dear! And Stoll is our
camera-man&mdash;none better in the profession. Our people are
pretty good,&mdash;one or two miscast, I fear,&mdash;and we can get
all the extras we can use, right here,&mdash;it&#8217;s hick-stuff, my dear,
and there&#8217;s poods of it at hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;My people bought Quilling&#8217;s novel for $50,000. You
should have heard Levant scream! But Dick Quilling can&#8217;t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
be had for nothing, and Crystal Gray herself did the continuity.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid to tell you how our footage stands&mdash;and no
interiors so far. But our sets will be few and will cost
nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should Tobacco shriek? We have our release already
through the Five Star, and we get back our cost of
production. Isn&#8217;t that sound business?</p>

<p>&#8220;Besides, five weeks should be sufficient for studio shooting.
We get the Willow Tree Studios. Frank Donnell will
do the cutting in the Lansing Laboratories, and use their
projection rooms.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve a peach of a part if I&#8217;m up to it. Nobody else near
me. Wally Crawford plays opposite&mdash;a very trying kid&mdash;the
good-looking, smarty, rather common sort&mdash;all plastered
hair and eyelashes&mdash;you know?</p>

<p>&#8220;The other principals will do.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m <i>very</i> happy, Barry. I could even believe you sincere
if you were here&mdash;I mean believe it for an hour or two of
Westchester moonlight.</p>

<p>&#8220;I write Dad and Mother every night. They&#8217;ve been out
here in the car several times. Rosalind motored out Sunday.
We had an awfully good time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you want to come up before we strike our tents
and beat it for the Bronx?</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">&#8220;Yours contentedly,</span><br />

&#8220;<span class="smcap">Betsy B.</span></p>

<p>&#8220;P. S.&mdash;I forgot to say that your little prot&eacute;g&eacute;e, Eris, does
extremely well whatever is required of her. She plays one
of those self-conscious rustics, half educated, vain, credulous,
and with a capacity for a world of mischief. I&#8217;m a pig,
I suppose, but I&#8217;m glad Crystal Gray cut the part to slivers.
Eris has no experience and no training, of course, but she
screens well, is intelligent, and does exactly what Frank
Donnell tells her to do.</p>

<p>&#8220;She comes, diffidently, to sit in my hammock with me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
after dinner, and curls up like a tired kitten. But, like a
kitten, she is receptive, responsive, ready to play or be talked
to&mdash;an unspoiled, generous nature already actively forming
a character the daily development of which is very interesting
to watch.</p>

<p>&#8220;I told her I was writing to you. She asks, <i>very</i> shyly,
to be &#8216;faithfully remembered.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I, also, but <i>not</i> faithfully.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">A SHORT story every Sunday would have grilled the
brains out of anybody, even a born story-teller.</p>

<p>Perhaps quality might have suffered; perhaps the thread
of invention would have snapped had not Annan&#8217;s contract
with the <i>Planet</i> ended with September.</p>

<p>He had done twenty stories for Coltfoot in six months.
Those stories made Annan. It had finally come to&mdash;&#8220;Have
you read Barry Annan in this week&#8217;s number?&#8221; That, and
a growing hostility always certain to be aroused by recognition,
were making of the young man a personage.</p>

<p>From the very beginning, scarce knowing why, he had
avoided the shallow wallow of American &#8220;letters,&#8221; where the
whole herd roots and snouts&mdash;literati, critics, public,&mdash;gruffling
and snuffling for the legendary truffle disinterred and
gobbled up so long&mdash;so long ago.</p>

<p>Already the younger aspirants hailed him. Already the
dreary brethren of the obvious stared disapproval.</p>

<p>The dull read him as they read everything. It takes all
kinds of pasture to keep a cow in cud. She chews but never
criticises.</p>

<p>Realists peered at him evilly and askance. His description
of swill didn&#8217;t smell like the best swill. There were mutterings
of &#8220;heretic.&#8221;</p>

<p>The &#8220;small-town&#8221; school found fault with his microscope.
Waste nothing&mdash;their motto&mdash;had resulted in a demand for
their rag-carpets. But here was a man who saved only a
handful of threads and twisted them into a phrase which
seemed to do the duty of entire chapters. No, the small-town
school took a sniff at Annan and trotted on down the alley.</p>

<p>As for the Romanticists, squirming and writhing and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
weaving amid their mess of properties and scenery, what did
they want of the substance when the shadow cost nothing?</p>

<p>No, Annan didn&#8217;t fit anywhere. He was just a good story-teller.</p>

<p>Outside that, his qualifications for writing fiction were
superfluous, from an American audience&#8217;s point of view, for,
to please that audience, he didn&#8217;t have to write good English,
he didn&#8217;t have to be intellectual, cultured, witty, or a
gentleman. But these unnecessary addenda did not positively
count against him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>He talked over the situation with Coltfoot, who was loath
to lose him and muttered of moneys.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Mike,&#8221; concluded Annan, &#8220;I&#8217;ve had my romp in your
kindly columns. You let me train there. I feel fit for the
fight, now. I&#8217;m on tip-toe, all pepped up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How much do you want then?&#8221; demanded Coltfoot, unconvinced.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing. I&#8217;ve about a million things I want to try&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bosco,&#8221; nodded the other wearily;&mdash;&#8220;I know. But you&#8217;ll
end in a Coney Island show, matched against all comers to
eat twenty-five feet of sausages in twenty-five minutes....
Do a serial for us. We&#8217;ve never tried it but I believe the
newspaper is destined to put the magazine out of business.
I&#8217;ll take a chance, anyway. Will you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe. I&#8217;m going to do a story&mdash;a kind of novel&mdash;a
thing&mdash;something&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take it without sample or further identification. It
may cost me my job. Are we on?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you crazy Irishman. Let me alone, I tell you. I
may change my mind and try a play, or a continuity direct,&mdash;hang
it all, I might even burst into verse. Do you want some
poems?&#8221; he threatened.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Coltfoot calmly, &#8220;but I&#8217;ll take them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do one farewell article for you. I&#8217;ll do it to-night.
But that ends it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>&#8220;How about the poems?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re very kind,&#8221; said Annan laughing. &#8220;It&#8217;s just the
yoke, Mike. It hasn&#8217;t galled, but let me drop it for a while....
That stuff I did for you&mdash;well, it&#8217;s out of my system.
I don&#8217;t care, now, whether it&#8217;s good or bad; I shan&#8217;t do any
more anyway&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your public asks for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m through&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They want <i>that</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I won&#8217;t do any more. I don&#8217;t want to. I can&#8217;t. I
don&#8217;t think that way any longer. Damn it, I&#8217;ve gone on&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They haven&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let &#8217;em stay put, then,&#8221; growled Annan.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean you are going to abandon your public?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I move. If they don&#8217;t want to follow&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No writer can afford to abandon his public,&#8221; said Coltfoot,
seriously.</p>

<p>Annan, also serious, said slowly: &#8220;The Masters we scribblers
try to follow went that way. They went <i>on</i>. Few followed
them all the way.... Poe wrote only <i>one</i> &#8216;Tales of
the Grotesque&#8217;; Kipling wrote only one &#8216;Plain Tales from
the Hills&#8217;; Scott one &#8216;Ivanhoe,&#8217; Hawthorne one &#8216;Scarlet
Letter&#8217;; Cooper, Dickens, Thackeray only <i>the</i> one each....
And there was only one &#8216;Hamlet.&#8217;... And but one
&#8216;Inferno.&#8217;... And one &#8216;Song of Songs.&#8217;... And one
&#8216;Iliad.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>He shrugged: &#8220;So maybe, in my own cheap little job I
have hit my high-spot with those stories of yours....
Maybe.... But I&#8217;m going on, I&#8217;m going to write what I
please if it costs me my last reader.&#8221;</p>

<p>Coltfoot made his last effort: &#8220;Dumas wrote &#8216;Twenty
Years After&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There was only one &#8216;Three Musketeers.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure.... The greatest romance ever written....
Sure.... All right, Barry....&#8221;</p>

<p>That evening Annan made himself some black coffee and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
wrote his farewell article for Coltfoot. It took him only half
an hour and it left him too much keyed up for sleep. He
called his article: &#8220;The Great American Ass.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;September flowers gone to seed,&#8221; it began, deceptively;
&#8220;withering leaves and dry dirt&mdash;the Park and Fifth Avenue
at their shabbiest. Streets torn up, piles of sand, escaping
steam, puddles of mortar, red flag and red lantern crowning
the d&eacute;bris, and the whole mess stinking of illuminating gas:
heat, dirt, noise&mdash;unnecessary, incessant, hellish noise&mdash;seven
million sweating people milling like maggots in the
midst&mdash;your New York, fellow citizens, on an unwashed
platter!</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Of</i> the metropolis itself there is scarcely any beauty&mdash;a
church here, an office-building there, one or two statues, a
few dwellings:</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>In</i> the metropolis there is more beauty than anywhere
else in the world. It is to be found in the faces and figures
of its women and children.</p>

<p>&#8220;For the beauty of woman is as usual in New York as it
is rare in the capitals of Europe. Without the charm, symmetry,
vivacity of the faces of her women, New York would
be, indeed, the ugliest, dingiest, and stupidest metropolis in
the world.</p>

<p>&#8220;Flower-like her pretty women bloom all over the arid,
treeless agglomeration of mortar and metal, serene amid the
asinine clamour; smiling, piquant, nourished by suffocating
heat, flourishing in arctic cold, hardy, healthy, wonderful in
the vast abiding place of the Great American Ass,&mdash;New
York.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here is his stronghold and he runs it to suit himself.
Any woman manages her own flat far better.</p>

<p>&#8220;For your New Yorker comes of an untidy race, knowing
neither civic nor national pride in the proper sense.</p>

<p>&#8220;His forefathers cleared forests and lived among charred
stumps. He is aware of no inborn necessity for beauty.</p>

<p>&#8220;New York is the wastrel among states. Her sons pollute<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
streams; her country roads are vistas of bill-boards; even
the &#8216;eternal&#8217; hills that line the Hudson crumble daily into
cement. Here the Great American Ass found a Paradise
and created a Dump. He ravages, stamps out, obliterates the
lovely face of nature,&mdash;digs, burns, crushes, tramples. Hundreds
of miles of ghastly, charred forests mark the trail of
the Great American Ass among his mountains. Filthy sea-waves
dash his refuse upon his shores.</p>

<p>&#8220;Loud, wanton, strident, and painted his metropolis
sprawls, unbuttoned, on the island leering at ugliness and
devastation. And, in her dirty ears, the ceaseless and complacent
braying of the Great American Ass. Her lover, Bottom,
the eternal New Yorker.</p>

<p>&#8220;Any woman&#8217;s kitchen is cleaner and her household run
with greater economy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor bread&mdash;when France can teach him what bread
really is&mdash;poorly prepared food, making candy eaters of an
entire people&mdash;an alimentary viciousness unknown where
food is properly cooked and properly eaten.</p>

<p>&#8220;A <i>poor</i> people, you New Yorkers, spite of your money&mdash;poorly
educated, bodily and mentally; poor in physique; poor
sportsmen who tolerate professionalism as your popular
sport; too poor in spirit to submit to universal service for the
common weal.</p>

<p>&#8220;So poor that your laws are made for you by the most
recently settled and most ignorant section of the nation.</p>

<p>&#8220;The &#8216;Centre of Population,&#8217; with its incubus of half educated
women, prescribes your bodily and your moral menu.
And you become a metropolis of moonshiners.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you, Manhattan? Ruins already, alas, to build
upon&mdash;the Yankee Ninevah trodden by an ass less wild.</p>

<p>&#8220;And yet the endless caravans continue. Still, to New
York come all things, all people. And, alas, Youth comes
too, and all afire to see and learn and achieve. High ideals,
high hopes, vigour, courage, face to face with the Great
American Ass enthroned amid the d&eacute;bris.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>&#8220;Youth floundering in the dump-heap bares a clean sword
to hew its way to beauty. And strikes a shower of ashes.
There is no sympathy; no audience for beauty in New York.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dull eyes look on, dull minds weary. There is official
inquiry as to the purpose of &#8216;these here art artists.&#8217; The
waiter, taxi-driver, janitor, gambler of yesterday are the
arbiters of Art on Broadway to-day.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not a sword that Youth needs in New York; it is
a gas-mask. And, somewhere, Destiny is already mixing
mortar and Fate is baking bricks for that coming temple that
shall stand upon the futile ruins where, some day, shall be
disinterred the fossil bones of the Great American Ass.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Annan sent it to Coltfoot with a note:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;This is a crazy article. You don&#8217;t have to use it.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>Coltfoot used it. A few people laughed, a few protested,
the Middle West was angry, and the owners of the <i>Planet</i>
told Coltfoot to be more careful.</p>

<p>But the majority of New Yorkers liked the article, and
grinned, having been overfed on &#8220;our fair city&#8221; stuff.</p>

<p>Besides, the tendency of the times was toward the unpleasant.</p>

<p>Stilton and caviar are acquired tastes.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That night Annan made himself some black coffee and
began his first novel, &#8220;The Cloud.&#8221;</p>

<p>About three o&#8217;clock in the morning he tore up what he had
written and smoked another pipe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, the rotten start!&#8221; he yawned, conscious that inwardly
he was all a-tremble with creative power,&mdash;like a boiler that
taxes its safety valve.</p>

<p>The young vigour in him laughed its menace. All the
insolent certainty of youth was in his gesture as he flung the
torn manuscript into the fireplace.</p>

<p>That night he embarked upon the sea of dreams. He seldom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
dreamed. But this night tall clouds loomed in his sleep
and an ocean rolled away. His ship plunged on, always on,
he at the helm.</p>

<p>Far upon the storm-wastes pitched a tiny craft under
naked poles, hurled toward destruction. As he drove past
her under thundering sail he saw&mdash;for the first time in any
dream&mdash;the ghost of Eris lashed to the little helm, her death-white
face fixed, her gaze intent upon the last fading star.</p>

<p>He awoke calling to her, the strain of nightmare an agony
in his throat, and shaking all over. But now, awake, he
couldn&#8217;t understand what had so terrified him in his dream,
why he quivered so.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose I thought she couldn&#8217;t ride out the storm in
that cockle-shell,&#8221; he muttered, gazing at the grey warning
of dawn outside his windows.</p>

<p>The first sparrow chirped. Annan pulled the quilt over
his ears, disgusted.</p>

<p>&#8220;I ought to look up that kid,&#8221; he thought.</p>

<p>It was his last conscious effort until he awoke for another
day.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap2">ANNAN, leaving the Province Club&mdash;one of the remaining
threads attaching him to the conventional world&mdash;espied
Coltfoot.</p>

<p>They had not met in weeks, and they shook hands affectionately.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you doing these days, Mike?&#8221; inquired Annan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hunting geniuses as a dog hunts fleas. What&#8217;s your
latest effort, Barry?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No effort. I am awaiting with composure the birth of
my great novel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Any good?&#8221; demanded the other with professional curiosity.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s good enough to sell in Heaven,&#8221; replied Annan modestly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so good then,&#8221; grunted Coltfoot. &#8220;And if that&#8217;s all
you&#8217;re doing this afternoon, why not saunter along with
me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gladly, but whither?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To 57th Street. Frank Donnell is running Betsy Blythe&#8217;s
stuff this afternoon. Don&#8217;t you want to see it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, yes&mdash;of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>Annan signalled a club taxi in waiting; they rolled away
together, Coltfoot directing the driver to go to &#8220;The Looking
Glass&#8221;&mdash;quite the most charming little motion-picture
house yet erected on Manhattan Island.</p>

<p>&#8220;Albert Wesly Smull built it,&#8221; remarked Coltfoot. &#8220;It&#8217;s
a gem.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t Smull one of that bunch of sports behind Betsy
Blythe?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>&#8220;One of &#8217;em. I hear &#8216;The Looking Glass&#8217; is the first of
a string of picture houses that Smull means to build and
operate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I supposed that Wall Street men had learned to fight
shy of pictures,&#8221; remarked Annan.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t scare them away. It&#8217;s a bigger gamble than
their own. That&#8217;s why.&#8221;</p>

<p>They stopped at the pretty bit of colonial architecture on
Fifty-Seventh Street, and entered a private corridor where
an elevator whisked them to the third floor.</p>

<p>There were a number of people in Frank Donnell&#8217;s office.</p>

<p>Donnell, prematurely grey, smooth-shaven and with the
manners of a gentleman, greeted Coltfoot who, in turn, made
him known to Annan.</p>

<p>Other men spoke to them, Dick Quilling&mdash;whose novel had
been filmed for Miss Blythe&mdash;a dapper, restless young man,
eternally caressing a small and pointed moustache with nicotine-stained
fingers; Stoll, celebrated camera-man, silent,
dreamy and foreign; David Zanger, art-director, a stumpy,
fat man with no eyelashes, a round, pock-marked face,
frayed cuffs and dirty fingers.</p>

<p>Annan, looking about, discovered Betsy Blythe, returned
a smile for her swift frown, and went over to make his
peace for his long neglect of her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s that blooming continuity you were to do for
me?&#8221; she demanded irritably.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m still evolving it, most beautiful of women&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentle liar, you&#8217;ve never given it another thought. I
suppose you can&#8217;t help gazing at people as though you mean
what you say, can you, Barry?&#8221; And, to the man seated
beside her&mdash;&#8220;You remember Mr. Annan, Albert?&#8221;</p>

<p>Albert Wesly Smull got up&mdash;an elaborately-groomed man
of ruddy, uncertain age. His expression, always verging on
a smile, might have been agreeable if less persistent. He
had a disturbing habit of smiling rather fixedly at people
out of small, red-brown eyes.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>He knew Annan by sight, it appeared. They shook hands
politely.</p>

<p>&#8220;I used to see you in the Patroon&#8217;s Club,&#8221; said Mr. Smull.
&#8220;I know your aunt very well,&#8221; he added with his sanguine
smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Probably better than I do,&#8221; said Annan. &#8220;I&#8217;m socially
disinherited, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Smull&#8217;s reddish-brown eyes clung to Annan like two gadflies.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your aunt is a very wonderful old lady,&#8221; he said; &#8220;&mdash;a
great power in New York under the old r&eacute;gime&mdash;&#8221; His
eyes began to move, leaving Annan and turning toward the
window where people were grouped.</p>

<p>&#8220;The grand dame is done for in this town,&#8221; remarked
Betsy. &#8220;She&#8217;s as important in these days as a stuffed
Dodo.&#8221;</p>

<p>Annan caught sight of Rosalind Shore near the window;
Betsy shrugged her cong&eacute;; he went across to Rosalind, who
stood with other people looking at stills which Frank Donnell
was sorting on a table.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, ducky!&#8221; said Rosalind, extending one fair hand
and drawing Annan to her side. &#8220;We&#8217;re looking at Mr.
Stoll&#8217;s delightful stills. Isn&#8217;t this one interesting?&#8221;&mdash;holding
up the finished photograph. &#8220;How wonderfully Betsy
screens! Look, Nan,&#8221;&mdash;turning to one of the girls behind
her; and then, remembering, she introduced Annan to Nancy
Cassell, a small, blond girl, as nervously organised as a butterfly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your stories in the <i>Planet</i> have cost me many a tear, Mr.
Annan,&#8221; said Miss Cassell. &#8220;Why do you always exterminate
your heroes and heroines?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Somebody&#8217;s got to thin &#8217;em out,&#8221; he explained, &#8220;or they&#8217;d
become a pest like the sparrow and the potato beetle&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t save a pair for breeding they&#8217;ll become extinct,&#8221;
retorted Nancy. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to join a hero-heroine
protective association with a closed season for mating....<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
Please join.&#8221; Her eyes flickered provocation, curiosity, defiance.
As usual he ignored the challenge.</p>

<p>Donnell, with his gentle but wearied smile, handed her a
new photograph, and offered a second to Rosalind. Behind
them, in the recess of the window, was another girl, and
Donnell turned with kindly courtesy and handed her a still.
As he moved aside to give her room at the table, Annan, also,
politely made a place for her, noticing her supple grace as
she moved forward in silhouette, the sun, behind her, outlining
a curved cheek and slender neck.</p>

<p>And suddenly he knew her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eris!&#8221; he exclaimed, delighted.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was afraid you didn&#8217;t remember me, Mr. Annan&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>A slim hand, scarce ventured, lay in his,&mdash;lay very still
and cool and unresponsive.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eris,&mdash;<i>Eris!</i>&#8221; he repeated with a boyish warmth so unfeigned
that the bright colour slowly came into her face and
her hand reacted nervously to his.</p>

<p>Rosalind gave them a lazy glance over her shoulder:
&#8220;Ding-dong! Take your corners,&#8221; she said, offering them a
still in which Eris figured. And, to Eris: &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you something,
my dear; if I screened like you I&#8217;d quit squalling top
notes.... <i>Look</i> at her in this one, Barry! Isn&#8217;t she <i>too</i>
sweet? Isn&#8217;t Eris wonderful, Frank?&#8221;&mdash;to Mr. Donnell,
who smiled in his amiable, tired way and sorted out more
photographs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, my dear,&#8221; said Rosalind, offering another still to
Eris, &#8220;I can stand a prettier girl than I am for just so
long. But you and Barry may admire indefinitely if you
like.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lovely colour of embarrassment came into the girl&#8217;s
face as she took the photograph thrust upon her:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Stoll gets the best out of one,&#8221; she protested. &#8220;The
rest is all in the make-up, Rosalind&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The rest is all in <i>you</i>,&#8221; retorted Rosalind. &#8220;You&#8217;re scaring
us all stiff with your beauty. God help us to bear it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>Eris, holding her own picture, let her flushed glance stray
toward Annan as he bent beside her.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re coming into your own, Eris,&#8221; he said gaily. &#8220;I
can see what you have done for yourself already.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can see what <i>you</i> have done for me,&#8221; she replied
under her breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You gave me my chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense. Betsy did that. You are doing the rest for
yourself. You&#8217;re making good. That&#8217;s evident. You&#8217;re
happy, too.... Are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, little pilgrim,&#8221; he said smilingly, &#8220;I guess you
really knew your business that night under the stars in the
Park. And the credit is all yours&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s <i>yours</i>!&#8221; she interrupted with a sudden passion in her
voice that startled him.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear child,&#8221; he protested, but she went on breathlessly:</p>

<p>&#8220;I know what you&#8217;ve done if <i>you</i> don&#8217;t! You made it all
possible. This is what I craved; what I needed. It&#8217;s <i>life</i> to
me, Mr. Annan. And you gave it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had absolutely nothing to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You did! You had everything to do with it. From the
time you spoke to me in the Park to the time I left a letter
for you, I <i>lived</i> for the first time in my life. You don&#8217;t
understand. Kindness comes very easy to you&mdash;and&mdash;and
out of your rich store you are&mdash;are generous with the treasures
of your mind&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Something choked her; she averted her head.</p>

<p>Surprised, yet half inclined to laugh, he waited a moment.
Then:</p>

<p>&#8220;You are so delightfully grateful for nothing,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;I wish I really had done you a service.&#8221;</p>

<p>She spoke, unsteadily, still looking away from him:</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t understand.... I can&#8217;t trust myself now....<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
I seem to be emotional&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; She shook her head and
he saw the bobbed hair glimmer red against the sunny
window.</p>

<p>As they stood there in the curtained recess, Frank Donnell&#8217;s
voice rose above the general conversation:</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that operator nearly ready in the projection room?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Zanger left the room to inquire.</p>

<p>Annan turned and accidentally encountered Mr. Smull&#8217;s
fixed smile.</p>

<p>Something in the persistent, sanguine gaze of the man
annoyed him&mdash;as though Mr. Smull had had him under impertinent
observation for some time without his knowledge.
He turned to Eris:</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you really were under obligations to me,&#8221; he said
lightly, &#8220;&mdash;you assume imaginary ones so adorably. Shall
we go and see how you and Betsy behave yourselves on the
screen?&#8221;</p>

<p>She nodded with a swift intake of breath&mdash;let him draw
her arm through his. They followed the little crowd now
moving toward the review room.</p>

<p>Seated together there in the semi-darkness, they watched
Frank Donnell and Max Stoll take their places at desks on
a raised platform behind them. A stenographer, with pad
and pencil, came in and seated herself at Donnell&#8217;s elbow.</p>

<p>Out went the lights except the green-shaded globe on Donnell&#8217;s
desk. The screen sprang into silvery relief.</p>

<p>Donnell half turned, looking up over his shoulder toward
the concealed operator above:</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, Jim. Don&#8217;t speed her too much. About 85.
And watch your frames.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you ready, Mr. Donnell?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go ahead.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>No continuity was attempted. There were no titles, not
even scratch ones. Take followed take, faded or irised out.
Nobody unacquainted with the story could possibly follow it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>In the darkness and silence there was no sound except the
droning of the machine, and Donnell&#8217;s calm voice occasionally,&mdash;&#8220;Frame!
<i>Frame</i> her, Jim!&#8221; And whispered exclamations
of approval at some unusually beautiful shot of Stoll&#8217;s,
or at some fragment revealing Betsy, radiantly in action, or
a butterfly flash of Nancy Cassell, or a lovely glimpse of Eris.</p>

<p>The door of the outer corridor kept opening and closing
to admit professionals arriving late. The darkness was becoming
thronged with people standing back against the door
and walls.</p>

<p>Once, as Betsy was enduring a chaste embrace from Wally
Crawford, the film broke. Everybody joined in the gaiety.
Then the little audience re-settled itself with scrape of chair
and rustle of skirt as Donnell&#8217;s shaded globe glimmered out,
revealing a crowded room.</p>

<p>Annan leaned over toward Betsy: &#8220;Good work,&#8221; he said
cordially. &#8220;You&#8217;re splendid. I hope the story is as clever.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, Barry. Frank thinks it ought to go over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s beautifully cast and beautifully kissed, Betsy!&#8221;</p>

<p>Coltfoot&#8217;s voice from the dark: &#8220;&mdash;But the censor won&#8217;t
let you kiss anybody but your grandmother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Great stuff, Betsy,&#8221; added Rosalind from somewhere.
&#8220;God and the Middle West will forgive that kiss!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All set, Mr. Donnell,&#8221; came the operator&#8217;s voice from
above.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go ahead!&#8221; The light in the shaded globe snapped off;
the drone of the machine filled the room. On the screen
Eris, in a rowboat, rested on her oars and laughed at Betsy
swimming toward her, pursued by her young man. His permanent
wave defied the waves.</p>

<p>Annan thought: &#8220;Betsy is sure an artist or she&#8217;d never
stand for the beauty of this child, Eris.... I wonder how
long she <i>can</i> afford to stand for it?&#8221;</p>

<p>He bent close to the girl in the wicker chair beside him:
&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t know that you really had it in you, Eris, could
I?&#8221; he whispered.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>&#8220;Do you think I have?&#8221; she breathed.</p>

<p>He whispered: &#8220;I <i>know</i> it. You are a born actress, Eris.
Your work is charming.&#8221;</p>

<p>He felt her breath lightly on his cheek:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all Frank Donnell: <i>I</i> wouldn&#8217;t know what to do. He
tells me and shows me. I try to comprehend. I do exactly
what he tells me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you weren&#8217;t a born actress, even Frank Donnell
couldn&#8217;t do anything with you. It&#8217;s <i>you</i>, Eris. You&#8217;re intelligent;
you&#8217;re lovely to look at. I can&#8217;t see why your future
isn&#8217;t in your own hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m simply crazy to talk to you about it. Could I?&#8221; she
whispered excitedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; he said, much flattered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve wanted to for so long. There are so many things,
Mr. Annan&mdash;and you could tell me why.&#8221;</p>

<p>Still the same, wistful cry, &#8220;Will you tell me why?&#8221;&mdash;and
he remembered it, now, guiltily, sorry for his long neglect.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you still living in Jane Street, Eris?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I come to see you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t a place to receive you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only a bed-room? It wouldn&#8217;t do, I suppose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They wouldn&#8217;t let me. Mrs. Plummer is strict&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite right.... Do you mind dining with me some
evening?&#8221;</p>

<p>She hesitated: &#8220;Where?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anywhere you choose. The Ritz?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t&mdash;suitable clothes&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you feel that way, will you dine with me at my house?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re so kind, Mr. Annan. I&#8217;d love to! When may
I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Their whispering was making somebody in front restless.
Annan&#8217;s slight pressure on her arm silenced her. He seemed
to recollect that Mr. Smull sat directly in front of Eris; and,
again, very vaguely he was conscious of irritation.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>There was no use in attempting to guess at the story
which the machine above was steadily unreeling. It all
seemed an inconsequential jumble of repetitions, full of
aggravating close-ups&mdash;which better taste, some day, will
eliminate from the screen.</p>

<p>When he thought Mr. Smull was again quiescent, Annan
placed his lips close to the unseen ear of the girl beside him:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come Thursday at seven.... Shall I ask anybody
else?&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook her head. Then, turning impulsively to whisper
to him, in the darkness her lips brushed his.</p>

<p>Instantly she recoiled, almost upsetting her chair, and he
caught it and steadied her.</p>

<p>His inclination to laugh subsided. He could not see her
face, but, in the chilled silence, he was conscious of her dismay
and of her rigid body beside him.</p>

<p>The shock of contact confused him, too. A delicate perfume
of chaste youth seemed to cling to him, invade him,
disturbing his natural ease and fluency. For the first time in
his life, perhaps, he found nothing flippant to say.</p>

<p>For a long while they remained mute, unstirring, as the
endless reel droned on and on.</p>

<p>Finally,&mdash;and very careful not to touch her,&mdash;he ventured
to whisper:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not make it this evening&mdash;unless you are otherwise
engaged?&#8221;</p>

<p>He could scarcely hear her reply: &#8220;Mr. Smull is giving
a dinner for Betsy. I promised to go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Who</i> is giving the party?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Smull.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again he experienced a vague sense of irritation.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you had no dinner gown,&#8221; he said drily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Betsy offered me one of hers.&#8221;</p>

<p>After a silence he said cheerfully: &#8220;I hope you&#8217;ll have a
gay evening, Eris. Call me up when you care to dine with
me.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>They watched the screen for a while, not speaking. Presently,
however, she whispered: &#8220;I wish I could, to-night.
I&#8217;d rather be with you. I&#8217;ve waited so long.... And now&mdash;I
can&#8217;t! And I&#8217;m heartbroken, Mr. Annan.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was beginning to realise that the candour of this girl
held an unsuspected but unmistakable charm for him. He
said under his breath:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll drive you home when this is over. We can plan
things then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t, Mr. Annan. Mr. Smull has offered to drive me
home.&#8221;</p>

<p>A disagreeable sensation&mdash;the same indefinite feeling&mdash;dismissed
with a slight shrug;&mdash;and suddenly, subtly, this
girl&#8217;s position and his own slipped into the reverse. Now it
was he who seemed to have waited so long for a chance to
talk to her,&mdash;he who was becoming impatient.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you give me to-morrow evening, Eris?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m sorry! There is another party. I promised
Betsy to go with her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is Mr. Smull perpetually giving parties?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s somebody else. I don&#8217;t remember who. Mr. Smull
is taking Betsy and me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you any time at all to give me this week?&#8221; he inquired,
the slightest hint of sarcasm in his pretended amusement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Thursday. May I come?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am flattered speechless.&#8221;</p>

<p>He rather felt than saw her turn toward him in her chair,
then subside in silence.</p>

<p>He leaned over, closer:</p>

<p>&#8220;I <i>want</i> you; I didn&#8217;t realise how much I wished to talk
to you,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I want you to come and dine at the
house, Eris, and tell me everything you care to. Will
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>After a while, slowly: &#8220;I need to ... if you&#8217;ll let me....
You don&#8217;t seem to understand how much you mean<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
to me. I never before talked to a man like you. I&#8217;ve been
wild to see you again&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know it!&#8221; she said passionately. &#8220;You fascinate
me! If you&#8217;ll only talk to me, sometimes, I can learn something!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll talk to you until you find out what a fraud I am,&#8221;
he whispered, still laughing. &#8220;On your own bobbed head be
it! I&#8217;m not proof against such charming flattery as yours.
Is it to be Thursday, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please!&mdash;And thank you so much&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you <i>promise</i>, Eris?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I? Oh, you know I do. You are laughing at me, Mr.
Annan&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very serious. I want you to promise to come&mdash;whether
Mr. Smull gives a party or not&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You <i>are</i> laughing at me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You listen to me! I&#8217;m never going to let you go again,&#8221;
he said with an ardour for which, later, he was unable to
account. &#8220;This is the beginning of a friendship. And that&#8217;s
a serious business, Eris.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she whispered solemnly, &#8220;it is. How can I ever
thank you? I&#8217;ve dreamed of it often; but I didn&#8217;t dare hope
for it.... Do you <i>really</i> feel as I do, Mr. Annan?&#8221;</p>

<p>He had come to a point where he was not quite sure of
what he did feel. The increasing charm of her was confusing
and upsetting him,&mdash;he having suddenly to do with
a kind of emotion to which he was naturally averse. No
woman had ever touched him, sentimentally ... so far....
What Eris was doing to him he did not comprehend.</p>

<p>In a sort of instinctive bravado he leaned toward her and
laid his hand firmly over hers.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re very generous,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I could have gone to
see you and I didn&#8217;t. That wasn&#8217;t friendly of me. Your
loyalty makes me ashamed. If you&#8217;ll give me another chance
to be of practical use&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>Her nervous fingers pressed his in protest: &#8220;No&mdash;not that!
I thought I made it clear&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean&mdash;money&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll never accept it,&#8221; she whispered fiercely. &#8220;I only
want <i>you</i>! Don&#8217;t you know that I&#8217;ve been starved all my life
and that you are the first person who ever satisfied me!
Can&#8217;t you understand what such a man means to me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Her amazing intellectual passion for him swept him clean
off his feet:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll never let you go again, never!&#8221; he whispered, not very
clear as to what he meant.</p>

<p>She clung to his hand in pledge of the pact, every intellectual
aspiration excited, thrilled to the spirit by sheerest
delight.</p>

<p>As for him, emotions unsuspected and inextricably confused
set his youthful brain spinning.</p>

<p>Disbelief, reluctance, fastidiousness, pride, perhaps, and
constant mental preoccupation had steered this young man
clear of lesser emotions. His few love affairs had been born
of a mischievous curiosity. No woman had ever really
stirred him,&mdash;not even intellectually. Women were agreeable
to go about with, amusing to analyse; characters to build
on, to create. That was the real r&ocirc;le they played in his
career.</p>

<p>And now, for the first time in his life, emotional impulse
had upset his complacent equilibrium, and had incited him
to say and do things, the import of which was not very
clear to him.</p>

<p>And he hadn&#8217;t yet come to his senses sufficiently to analyse
the situation and discover what it was all about.</p>

<p>In the darkness, beside her, the charm of her seemed to
envelop him progressively&mdash;steal stealthily through and
through him, stimulating his imagination, exciting his curiosity
and a swiftly increasing desire to learn more about her.</p>

<p>The honesty of her admiration for him flattered him as he
never before had been flattered. Such na&iuml;ve, such ardent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
adoration quite upset his mental balance, and slightly intoxicated
him.</p>

<p>Nothing ever had so appealed, so moved this sophisticated
young man. And, add the girl&#8217;s beauty, and nascent talent
to that, the total was too much for him&mdash;might have been
too much for older and more level heads than Barry
Annan&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thursday,&#8221; he whispered, as she slowly released her
hand from his&mdash;freed it with a sort of winning reluctance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she breathed, &#8220;at seven.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And many, many other hours together,&#8221; he added fervently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I hope so.... Thank you, Mr. Annan.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sitting in silence there he had a confused idea that never
had he encountered a feminine mind so utterly purged of
material sentiment.</p>

<p>&#8220;It behooves me to keep my own brain as clear,&#8221; he
thought, vaguely,&mdash;seeming to realise that it was no longer
entirely so.</p>

<p>Suddenly the drone of the machine ceased; the lights
went on; the screen faded.</p>

<p>All around him people stirred, rose, turned to exchange
impressions, congratulations.</p>

<p>The light sobered Annan. He turned almost apprehensively
to look at Eris.</p>

<p>Something radical happened to him as he met her grey
eyes,&mdash;crystal-clear eyes, beautiful, unabashed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye,&#8221; he said in a voice that sounded odd in his
own ears.</p>

<p>Once more he took her hand, and the contact stirred him
to definite emotion. Had she been experienced she could
have seen much to astonish and trouble her girl&#8217;s soul in this
young man&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye,&#8221; she said with adorable frankness, &#8220;&mdash;and
thank you&mdash;always&mdash;Mr. Annan.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he went away toward the corridor where Coltfoot stood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
talking to Rosalind, he began to realise that something had
happened to him.</p>

<p>Rosalind, seeing him, crinkled her eyes and wrinkled her
fascinating nose:</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you turn her head, Barry? Is that child to follow
Betsy and myself? Everybody noticed you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He said, annoyed: &#8220;She wouldn&#8217;t consider that very humorous.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rosalind&#8217;s dark eyes widened lazily: &#8220;Did you suppose I
meant it, Barry? You&#8217;re rather crude for a subtle novelist,
aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She wouldn&#8217;t understand it,&#8221; he repeated, annoyed.
&#8220;She&#8217;s an unusually sensitive girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went on along the corridor to take leave of Frank
Donnell.</p>

<p>Rosalind looked at Coltfoot, inclined to giggle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t think it,&#8221; said Coltfoot with a shrug.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know&mdash;&#8221; Rosalind turned and looked across at
Eris. Smull had seated himself beside her in Annan&#8217;s chair.
Other men gathered around her. Her beauty startled Rosalind.</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be funny,&#8221; she said. &#8220;That child has no heart.
Neither has Barry Annan.... They&#8217;re merely a pair of
minds.... It would be funny if they became entangled
... intellectually.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">THEY didn&#8217;t dine together at Annan&#8217;s house in Governor&#8217;s
Place; or anywhere else.</p>

<p>Eris tried desperately to get him on the telephone. A
few minutes before train time she telegraphed:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;Am leaving unexpectedly at three o&#8217;clock this afternoon
for the Pacific Coast. Heart-broken on account of our engagement.
Shall write from train.</p>

<p class="right">&#8220;Eris.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>When Annan returned about six to order dinner and
flowers, and to dress for the r&ocirc;le of host, he found her
telegram.</p>

<p>Whatever is snatched away from man or beast instantly
becomes disproportionately desirable.</p>

<p>It was so with Annan. Suddenly he realised how much
he wanted Eris. Really he had not thought much about this
dinner, except immediately after their meeting at the <i>Looking
Glass</i>.</p>

<p>He had borne it in mind, impatiently the first day, pleasurably
the second, with complacent equanimity thereafter.
But he <i>had</i> remembered it.</p>

<p>For the moments of surprise and emotion so charmingly
experienced in the projection room had little else except surprise
for a foundation. Curiosity alone perpetuated them.</p>

<p>To a young man agreeably immersed in his own affairs
such episodes became incidents very quickly. Only an unexpected
obstacle evokes afresh circumstances and emotions
which have become vague.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>Her telegram did this. Disappointment, retrospection,
regret, annoyance, sentimental impatience,&mdash;these in sequence
possessed the young man as he sat holding her telegram.
The only mitigation seemed to be in her statement
concerning her broken heart. That flattered and helped.</p>

<p>He was in no mood to dine out, but he didn&#8217;t want to dine
at home alone. The conflict continued, full of sentimental
indecision.</p>

<p>It ended by his ringing for Mrs. Sniffen, ordering a cold
bite on a tray, stripping to undershirt, chamber-robe, and
slippers, and plunging into his novel, now well under way.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>About eleven next morning, in similar attire, and with an
electric fan whizzing in the room, he interrupted work long
enough to open the envelope which Mrs. Sniffen brought
him and which bore a special delivery stamp:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;Dear Mr. Annan:</p>

<p>&#8220;I tried to get you on the telephone up to the last moment.
The disappointment seemed too much for me after I had
waited so long. I could have wept. I didn&#8217;t; I don&#8217;t weep
easily. But the vision of the evening we might have had
haunts me every moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is what happened. The directors who finance the
Betsy Blythe Films suddenly decided to send us to the Coast
for the new pictures. The reasons, I believe, are economical.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you imagine the company&#8217;s consternation? We had
no time to prepare ourselves. If Mr. Smull and Betsy hadn&#8217;t
stopped and taken me in Mr. Smull&#8217;s car I couldn&#8217;t have
caught the train.</p>

<p>&#8220;My only consolation is that the play seems to be a good
one and they have given me a part&mdash;a darling part if I do it
decently. I was to have had only a maid&#8217;s part but Miss
Cassell refused to go to the Coast and there wasn&#8217;t time to
recast the part.</p>

<p>&#8220;Even then I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;d have given it to me if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
Mr. Smull hadn&#8217;t said that he&#8217;d like me to have it. I pray
humbly that I may be equal to it. Never has anything so
excited me as this chance.</p>

<p>&#8220;But if only I could have known it, and spent every second
talking it over with you! I don&#8217;t mean that Mr. Donnell is
not my hope and salvation; but you are <i>you</i>, Mr. Annan,
and there is no other man&#8217;s mind that stimulates and enthralls
mine as yours does.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t forget me. Please write to me. I know it
is a very great deal to ask of such a man. But you <i>are</i> kind,
and you are famous; and I am ignorant and a nobody.
Whatever you say helps. Just your voice, even your smile,
acts on me like intellectual tonics&mdash;that lazy, wise, kindly,
perplexing smile, so mischievously experienced, that encourages
yet warns! I <i>wanted</i> it so desperately. I needed it&mdash;and
you&mdash;just when I felt that my career was beginning.
Oh, Mr. Annan, please understand and please, please don&#8217;t
forget me.</p>

<p class="right">&#8220;Eris.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>In a postscript she gave her address in Los Angeles.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Much flattered and genuinely touched, he wrote her immediately.</p>

<p>The glamour lasted for the next few weeks. Complacency
is a great stimulation to memory. A bland satisfaction in
the ardent mental attitude of Eris toward himself incited
him to real effort in his letters. He became expansive&mdash;a
trifle sentimental when he thought of the girl&#8217;s beauty&mdash;but
only airily so&mdash;and he rather settled down to a Chesterfieldian
attitude toward his unusual and odd little prot&eacute;g&eacute;e.</p>

<p>Wisdom in wads he administered with a surprising solemnity
foreign to his accustomed attitude toward himself.</p>

<p>However, his flippancy <i>was</i> an attitude as far as it concerned
his belief in himself. Because this young man really
took himself very devoutly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>He prescribed a course of reading for Eris. He formulated
rules of conduct, exposed pitfalls, impressed maxims
in epigrams, discoursed on creative and interpretive art. It
was perversely clever. He used some of the material in his
novel.</p>

<p>This was all very well. The girl&#8217;s letters were charming
and touching; the correspondence was excellent practice for
him, and part of it could be salvaged for practical ends.</p>

<p>But there were in use at that time, among the semi-educated,
two cant-words which the public, now, was working
to rags;&mdash;<i>psychology</i> and <i>complex</i>.</p>

<p>And it was these words that suggested to Annan that his
letters to Eris might, more profitably to himself, become experiments
in research and vivisection.</p>

<p>Toward that angle,&mdash;and with all the delicacy and technical
skill possessed by him,&mdash;he started a cautious exploration
of her character as a &#8220;type,&#8221; including that untouched
and undiscovered side which comprehended the impulses, material
motives, emotional passions, popularly attributed to
the human heart in contradistinction to phenomena purely
intellectual.</p>

<p>Several letters came from her without any notice being
taken of his investigations. Apparently she either possessed
no such side to her character or else she did not understand
him. Anyway, there was no response, and therefore no
revelation of herself to satisfy his professional curiosity.</p>

<p>One thing seemed to become clearer and clearer; he had
not appealed to this girl except intellectually. Of lesser sentiment
in her there was not a hint or a trace in all her correspondence&mdash;only
ardent gratitude for material kindness and
passionate response to a generous mind that had offered itself
to a starved one.</p>

<p>He had concluded that his subtle and mischievous epistolary
philandering was not destined to reveal any dormant
inclinations to response in Eris&mdash;much less any natural aptitude
or acquired skill.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>And he was debating in his leisure moments whether or
not such total unconsciousness was normal or otherwise,
when out of a serene sky came a letter from her in reply to
his last and cleverest experiment in reactions:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;Dear Mr. Annan:</p>

<p>&#8220;Until rather lately it never occurred to me to analyse my
feeling of friendship for you.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know exactly how to. I have tried. It confuses
me.</p>

<p>&#8220;I like <i>everything</i> you say. I didn&#8217;t realise I was silent
concerning any phase of our friendship. But I had not
thought of your having any liking for me outside of your
natural kindness to me. Or that I had any personal charm
for you; or that you might like to be with me even if we do
not say a word to each other.</p>

<p>&#8220;That idea of companionship had not entered my head.
But now that you have spoken of it&mdash;or your letters, lately,
have seemed to suggest it&mdash;I am venturing to reply that, just
being with you is a pleasure to me ... just to walk with
you and remain mentally idle, I mean. I realised it only
when you spoke of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Friendship seems to be very complex. You must remember
that this is my first intelligent friendship. It quite
overshadows all other associations. So I really do not know
just where my feeling for you could fail to include all the
best that is in me.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to talk to you about it. If only you were here!
Do you know that if it were not for your letters I&#8217;d be unhappy
here, in spite of my beloved profession?</p>

<p>&#8220;Is this what you would like to have me say to you?</p>

<p>&#8220;You drew a picture of yourself as a brain on two legs;
and of me in academic cap and gown, with a silly expression
on my face, clasping both hands in ecstasy before you. Out
of your brain comes a balloon with something written in
Latin&mdash;&#8216;Animus est in patinis.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>&#8220;I asked Mr. Donnell. He said it meant, &#8216;My mind is
among the sauce-pans.&#8217; In other words, you mean that your
mind sometimes harbours material thoughts, while mine is
the stupid, empty mind of a horrid, unhuman, intellectual
sponge!</p>

<p>&#8220;That is very impudent of you. Good heavens, if I <i>am</i>
like that, it will ruin me for my profession!</p>

<p>&#8220;Experience is what I lack. I sit and actually beat my
head with both hands when, at moments, I catch a glimmer
of all that I ought to be and ought to have experienced, and
ought to know.</p>

<p>&#8220;Education is everything! One&#8217;s career depends on it.
Yet, <i>is</i> experience necessary to education? It can not always
be. The prospect would seem terrifying. And of course
any such theory becomes ridiculous in the last analysis.</p>

<p>&#8220;We were discussing that question the other evening&mdash;Mr.
Donnell, Betsy, Mr. Smull&mdash;he arrived unexpectedly last
Monday&mdash;and I was listening, not taking part in the discussion&mdash;when
Mr. Smull said that nobody was fit to play a
person in love unless he or she had actually been in love.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know that startled me. After a while it scared me,
too.</p>

<p>&#8220;I asked Mr. Donnell, privately, if that were true, and he
laughed and said that several perfectly respectable women,
guiltless of murder, had successfully played Lady Macbeth.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m still wondering. Of course it isn&#8217;t necessary to
murder somebody in order to play the part of an assassin.</p>

<p>&#8220;But murder is an overt act. A murderous state of mind
need not have any concrete consequence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Love, also, must be a state of mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;So do you think that one must have been actually in love
to interpret convincingly in a play whatever results of love
are to be presented?</p>

<p>&#8220;I asked Betsy. She said yes. So I suppose she has been
in love, because she does her part convincingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;But what about me if ever I am cast for such a part?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
Yet, it seems to me that I ought to have enough instinct and
intelligence to know how to be convincing.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see Mr. Smull wants me to play second to Betsy in
the next production; and the part is a girl in love who has
a most unhappy time until the very end of the play.</p>

<p>&#8220;One can study, read up, and prepare; but one can not
enter into <i>that</i> state of mind at will.</p>

<p>&#8220;So, if they give me the part I have concluded to approximate
by thinking of my friendship for you, which is the
most important event in my life.</p>

<p>&#8220;It ought to represent the state of mind in question. It&#8217;s
got to. Do you think I could play that part convincingly?
Why not? Because my idea of a person in love is that there
is only one object of supreme affection. And I don&#8217;t care
for anybody as much as I do for you. Why can&#8217;t I build on
that?&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>Charmed, humiliated, thrilled by her candour, the humour
of her appeal went straight home to Annan.</p>

<p>For here was this girl innocently proposing to analyse and
use her friendship for him to aid her in her profession;&mdash;the
very thing that he had been doing so cynically.</p>

<p>Every word she wrote was helping him, professionally.
Every line he had written in reply was evidently a source of
professional inspiration to her.</p>

<p>It was not flattering to him, but it was funny. And, somehow,
it knocked sentiment out of his letters: knocked out
the letters, too, toward the end of the year.</p>

<p>The anesthetic of old Doctor Time is certain and irresistible.
Sooner or later constancy fades, memory evaporates,
humanity succumbs. Only the dog resists the anesthetic of
old Doctor Time.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>By February Annan had been in arrears for two months;
and the effort to re-open the correspondence bored him.</p>

<p>Pigeon-holed, the memory of her would keep sufficiently
fresh until such time&mdash;if ever&mdash;she was resurrected in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
flesh and came again into the trail he travelled through life.</p>

<p>He heard of her occasionally when he encountered Rosalind,
who corresponded with Betsy.</p>

<p>Eris was being favourably discussed on the Coast.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In March a Betsy Blythe film was shown at <i>The Looking
Glass</i>,&mdash;following that first film, parts of which he had seen
the previous autumn in the projection room.</p>

<p>Once or twice he attempted to see the new picture&mdash;rather
as a sort of obligation&mdash;but the place was crowded. Somehow
time passed very swiftly for Annan; and when again
he thought about it the picture was gone; and a new Betsy
Blythe picture had replaced it,&mdash;playing to a crowded house
as before;&mdash;and Annan went once, failed to get in, and let
it slip his memory.</p>

<p>Not that his conscience did not meddle with his complacency
at times. It did.</p>

<p>Her last three letters still remained unanswered.</p>

<p>But his novel was the vital, supreme thing which crowded
out all else&mdash;even the several pretty and receptive girls whose
stellar orbits had intersected his during the winter and early
spring.</p>

<p>The joy of literary achievement was his chiefest pleasure;
its perils his excitement, its fatigue the principal sleep-inducer
that sent him at last to a tardy pillow.</p>

<p>Coltfoot read a typed copy.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll be the making of you, I suppose,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but it&#8217;s
all wrong, Barry. Popular and punk!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why the devil do you say that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It <i>is</i> wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were dining at Annan&#8217;s <i>&agrave; deux</i>, and had strolled into
the living-room with their cigars.</p>

<p>&#8220;You sit down, Mike, and tell me why my book is popular
and punk!&#8221; said Annan wrathfully.</p>

<p>Coltfoot dropped onto the piano stool, sounded a few dissonances
evolved by a master-modernist; sneered.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>&#8220;Barry,&#8221; he said, &#8220;if art isn&#8217;t wholesome it&#8217;s only near-art.
What is good is also healthy. If art is good it is sane,
always; and always beautiful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard that song you sing. It&#8217;s an ancient rag, Mike.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s real music, Barry&mdash;not <i>this</i>!&mdash;&#8221; he struck a series of
dissonant, ugly, half-crazed chords from the most modern
creation of the most modern of modernists. &#8220;That&#8217;s diseased,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;There is no virtue, no beauty, no art in
disease.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; remarked Annan, &#8220;I might mention ambergris,
pat&eacute;-de-fois-gras, the virtues of ergot, the play of
colour, and the flower-like perfume of a dying grayling, and
the&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re going to be flippant&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. Go on, Mike.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Barry, do you understand the origin of this modern &#8216;revolt&#8217;&mdash;this
sinister cult of dullness, perversity, ugliness? It
was born in Bolshevism. Which is degeneracy. It is the
worship of ugliness. It is known to scientists as Satanism.</p>

<p>&#8220;Once the prisons and asylums were the ultimate destinations
of the degenerate. Because degenerates, then, had no
safe outlet in the fine arts. Their manifestations were matters
for police control.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, they have their outlets in literature, drama, music,
sculpture, painting. And their vicious or crazy creations
profoundly impress The Great American Ass. Why?
Because he&#8217;s ignorant, and art awes him. But he&#8217;s also,
physically, a healthy beast, and he doesn&#8217;t understand the
degeneracy that masquerades as art.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is ugly, morbid, dull, rotten, cynical, pessimistic,
is degenerate. To dwell upon disease in creative work is
degeneracy. To seek out, analyse, celebrate, perpetuate ugliness,
deformity, decay, is degeneracy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet, that is modernism. That is the trend. That is what
is being done. That is what the new generation of creative
genius offers,&mdash;and what it calls realism,&mdash;a dreary multiplicity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
of photographic items; a sordid recapitulation of
daily and meaningless details; inspiration from models of
distorted minds and bodies; ugliness lovingly delved for and
dragged out into clean sunshine; triumphant exposure of the
mentally, morally, and physically crippled.</p>

<p>&#8220;But there is the worse phenomenon&mdash;the degenerate
writer, painter, sculptor, who sees ugliness in beauty, decay
in health, atrophy in the normal,&mdash;and who caricatures the
healthy and beautiful living model to evolve the ugly and
obscene spectres that haunt his brain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Such are the so-called modernists. Their outer limit
inside the bounds of sanity are Manet and Degas.</p>

<p>&#8220;Beyond that is the bedlam of Cezanne and Gauguin&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, old chap&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I <i>am</i> saying it. It&#8217;s the same old crisis&mdash;Rome or the
Barbarians; Europe or Attila; the Prussians or Civilization.</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you these half-crazed brains are beating at the gates
of the world&#8217;s sanity to overthrow Reason from her very
seat!</p>

<p>&#8220;Any alienist can tell you what the cult of ugliness means&mdash;what
the morbid desire to mutilate means. What does it
matter whether the living human body be the victim, or the
attack be made upon figments of the imagination&mdash;whether
upon the established order of harmony in music, or upon the
pure standard of Greek sculpture, or upon the immortal
beauty and symmetry in the pictures of the Great Masters!</p>

<p>&#8220;The point is this: the desire to mutilate is there; the murderous
mania has discovered a safe outlet with pen, brush,
chisel for weapons instead of pistol and butcher knife.</p>

<p>&#8220;The modernist is no longer a Ripper, except by intention.
His degenerate fury wreaks itself on Art.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go to a Modernist Exhibition. Once the walls of an
asylum would have been decorated with these drawings.
Read modernist literature. Scrawled in prison bath-rooms
would have been these lines in saner days. Listen to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
music of your modernist. Only Bedlam could have produced
and enjoyed it, once.</p>

<p>&#8220;But to-day all crack-brains are being drawn together
under the Bolshevistic impulse to swarm, mutilate what is
beautiful, destroy what lies within the eternal laws, annihilate
all order, all that has withstood the test of civilisation.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Great American Ass hears the pandemonium and
looks over the walls at the crazed herd of his demented fellows
milling around the citadel.</p>

<p>&#8220;He looks at them and wags his ears, interested, perplexed.
They&#8217;ll tear him to pieces if they get in&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good God!&#8221; burst out Annan, &#8220;&mdash;what has this to do
with my novel&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s tainted. It&#8217;s infected with the cult of ugliness. So
were your short stories in the <i>Planet</i> that gave you a name!
You&#8217;re stained with modernism.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Damn it, I&#8217;m personally decent&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some of the lunatics are, too. But the hullabaloo they&#8217;re
making is bound to affect&mdash;and infect&mdash;impressionable
minds. All healthy and creative minds are impressionable.
Yours is. This satanic cult of ugliness has influenced your
mind to more sombre, more incredulous, less wholesome
creations.</p>

<p>&#8220;All genius is imitative in some degree. You don&#8217;t escape,
Barry. The body-vermin of literature&mdash;the so-called modern
critics&mdash;all are applauding you and tempting you to perpetuate
more of that sinister ugliness which deformed your first
work.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t do it. Remember the real standards. They never
change; only fashion changes. Stick to the clean master-jobs
of the real giants in your profession. Those are the
standards. Life is splendid. Man is fine. The beauty of
both are best worth recording in art. Leave degeneracy to
medicine. Leave modernism to the asylum. Make the cleavage
definite between art and science. Find your themes in
goodness, in beauty, in the nobility of the human mind&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>&#8220;Good heavens, Mike, are you one of those moral fanatics
who evoke blue-laws even for literature?&#8221;</p>

<p>Coltfoot slowly shook his head: &#8220;Barry, you won&#8217;t win
out until you change your attitude toward the God who made
you without a blemish. I&#8217;m telling you. The lunatic can&#8217;t
last. The dirty, greedy, commercial Jew or Christian art
dealer or publisher who exploits Satanism, Bolshevism, insanity,
for the sake of dirty dollars,&mdash;he has his thirty pieces
of silver. And that&#8217;s all.... I took mine&mdash;and published
your stories. I&#8217;m through. I&#8217;m a he-Magdalen. I&#8217;m off
that stuff.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve chucked the <i>Planet</i>,&#8221; said Coltfoot carelessly.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap2">ANNAN&#8217;S dreary, unpleasant and brilliantly ugly novel
was published in April. There were three printings in
the first week. Five in the second. In contradistinction to
&#8220;small-town stuff,&#8221; it was &#8220;big-town.&#8221; New York of
the middle-lower class. And it <i>was</i> New York. Stenograph
and photograph could verify every word uttered and every
portrait. The accuracy of its penny-gossip was amazing.
It was apotheosis in epigram of the obvious.</p>

<p>The determined ignoring of all beauty; the almost fanatical
blindness to everything except what is miserable, piddling,
sordid, and deformed in humanity; the pathetic loyalty to the
sort of &#8220;truth&#8221; which has a place in economic statistics if not
in creative art&mdash;the drab, hopeless, ignoble atmosphere where
swill was real enough to smell and where all delicacy and
functional privacy was sternly disregarded, caused a literary
uproar in the reading belt, and raucous applause among all
Realists.</p>

<p>There are good Christians and good Jews, both admirable
and loyal citizens of the Republic, good scholars, good soldiers,
good men.</p>

<p>There are intellectual Bolshevists among Christians&mdash;degenerate
fanatics, perverted Puritans; and among Jews are
their equivalents.</p>

<p>The bawling Christian literary critic who assaults with
Bolshevistic violence all literature except his own is a privileged
blackmailer and commits legal libel.</p>

<p>His Jewish confr&egrave;re is no more vulgar. Both are only
partly educated. They live parasitically upon the body of
literature. They are cooties.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>The several more notorious ones welcomed Annan. They
liked what he wrote because it was what they would have
written if they could. Later, if he didn&#8217;t continue to write
what they liked, they&#8217;d bite him. They had no other means
of retaliation.</p>

<p>One, named Minkwitz, who made a good living by biting
harder and with less discrimination than the usual literary
cootie, wrote a violent article in praise of raw realism, and
crowned Annan with it.</p>

<p>A female pervert on a Providence, Rhode Island, periodical
discovered that there was a &#8220;delicate stench&#8221; about Annan&#8217;s
realism which she found &#8220;rather stimulating than
otherwise.&#8221;</p>

<p>The joylessness of the novel appealed to the bluenose. He
read it and ordered his family to read it. They&#8217;d better
learn as much as possible about the &#8220;worm that never dies.&#8221;</p>

<p>All crack-brains read it and approved.</p>

<p>Then the Great American Ass read it. All Iowa borrowed
it from circulating libraries. Oklahoma read it. And finally
Nebraska placed upon it the official chaplet of literary success.</p>

<p>Finally everybody read it&mdash;everybody from uplifter to
shoplifter.</p>

<p>And it became a best-seller in rivalry with the exudations
of the favourite female writer of the Centre of Population&mdash;a
noisy and bad-tempered woman whose only merit was that
she unwittingly furnished scientific minds with material for
healthy laughter.</p>

<p>Thus the first novel of Barry Annan, purposely un-serialised
as a <i>ballon d&#8217;essai</i>, ascended to the skies like the fat,
bourgeois and severed soul of Louis XVI, amid a roll of
revolutionary drums.</p>

<p>The unusual aspect of the case was that, technically, the
book was nearly perfect; the style admirable and with scarce
a flaw. Now the Great American Ass understands nothing
of literary workmanship. Style means nothing to him. Yet
he bolted Annan&#8217;s book and seemed to enjoy the flavour.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
<i>Seemed</i> to. For one never can know anything definite about
an ass.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>From the Pacific coast Betsy Blythe wrote Annan. She
had read the novel. That, ostensibly, was her theme. She
applauded his fame, expressed herself as proud to be numbered
among the friends of such a celebrity.</p>

<p>Then there was some gossip about herself, the company,&mdash;inquiry
as to how he had liked the pictures which she assumed
he had seen in the East.</p>

<p>Then there was a paragraph: &#8220;What are you doing to
our Eris, Barry? I suppose it&#8217;s what you did to me, to
Rosalind, to every fresh and attractive face which possessed
ears to listen to your golden vocabulary. Still, I don&#8217;t see
how you had time: you saw her only that one afternoon in
the projection room, she tells me.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I suppose you&#8217;re as deadly by letter as otherwise.
Like measles I suppose we all have got to have you. Eris
had it harder, that&#8217;s all.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m going to tell you that when she recovers,&mdash;as
we all do,&mdash;you&#8217;ll be surprised at the charming creature she
is turning into.</p>

<p>&#8220;I honestly think she is the most intelligent girl I ever
knew. She not only <i>looks</i> but she sees. She learns like
lightning. The odd thing about her is the decided quality in
her. Her mind is the mind of a gentlewoman. As for the
externals&mdash;trick of voice and speech and bearing, it scarcely
seems as though she acquired them. Rather they seem to
have been latent in her, and have merely developed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet she tells me she is the daughter of very plain people.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Eris, in her way, is already a celebrity on the
Coast. She has become quite the loveliest to look at out
here. And she is a natural actress. There, my friend! Am
I generous?</p>

<p>&#8220;Alas, Barry, she worries me. I like her, admire her,
but&mdash;it seems ignoble in me&mdash;I can&#8217;t stand the competition.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
We can&#8217;t go on together. She&#8217;s too pretty and too clever.
It seems impossible to bury her under any part, no matter
how rotten.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;ll come a time when the Betsy Blythe Films will
mean only Eris.</p>

<p>&#8220;If she&#8217;s going to become as good as that she ought to
have her own company. She couldn&#8217;t stand such competition;
nobody could; and I&#8217;m not going to.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>I</i> don&#8217;t want to bury her; but if we go on playing together
she&#8217;ll bury me. It&#8217;s right that we should part, professionally.
It&#8217;s only fair to both of us.</p>

<p>&#8220;That darned Albert Smull is responsible. He&#8217;s been out
here three times. When it comes to casting the company,
outside of myself, what he wants is done. And he&#8217;s mad
about Eris.</p>

<p>&#8220;The last time he came out here, his partner, Leopold
Shill, came with him. Between them they do two-thirds of
our financing. Well, while they were, as always, perfectly
friendly to me, their interest was in Eris. How the devil am
I to make it plain to them that Eris and I ought not to be in
the same company?</p>

<p>&#8220;I <i>could</i> explain it to her and she&#8217;d understand. But Albert
Smull and Leo Shill would misunderstand, utterly, and
put me down as a jealous cat.</p>

<p>&#8220;So &#8216;that&#8217;s that,&#8217; as Eris has it when she&#8217;s made up her
mind. I&#8217;ve made up mine. I&#8217;ve got to kiss her good-bye.
But when I do I&#8217;ll kiss a future star. I&#8217;ll say so. You tell
&#8217;em.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye, you philandering but lovable egoist. I like
your rotten novel&mdash;not spontaneously&mdash;but because if one
only could like that sort of sob-stuff it&#8217;s the stuffiest, sobbyest
story I ever snivelled over.</p>

<p class="right">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Betsy.</span></p>

<p>&#8220;P. S.&mdash;Your dowdy, disagreeable aunt, Mrs. Magnelius
Grandcourt, is in Pasadena for her health&mdash;maybe her temper,
too&mdash;and she was nasty to me because I&#8217;m in pictures.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>&#8220;Of course I don&#8217;t mind: nobody pays any attention to
those old dames who ruled New York a decade ago. All
that ended with the war. She knows darned well where I
belong.</p>

<p>&#8220;But the funny part of it is that she&#8217;s taken a majestic
shine to Eris. She&#8217;s stopping with the Pelham-Cliffords
at their handsome place near Pasadena, and the Pelham-Cliffords
are live ones and they let us shoot some scenes on
their place.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was how your aunt had an opportunity to be nasty
to me. But exactly why she condescended to patronise Eris,
I don&#8217;t know.</p>

<p>&#8220;She continually asks the P-Cliffords to ask Eris over.
Eris goes occasionally. I asked her point-blank why that
peevish old party was so amiable to her, and she blushed in
that engagingly confused way and said that your aunt knew
her great grandmother.</p>

<p>&#8220;Apparently there <i>was</i> quality in the forebears of Eris,
or that dumpy old snob wouldn&#8217;t have made any fuss over
the great grandchild of somebody who died years and years
ago.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap2">ANNAN was in a way of being rather pleased with himself.
Nobody can remain entirely unshaken by the
impact of the sort of flattery hurled in hunks by the Great
American Ass.</p>

<p>For with him it is all or nothing, repletion or starvation.</p>

<p>Also, unlike his French and British brothers, he is a disloyal
ass. Also a capricious one. There is no respect in
him for past performance once lauded. The established
favourite grown old in service sooner or later becomes a
target for his heels.</p>

<p>This is not heartlessness; it is ignorance of what has been
done for him and of those who have done it.</p>

<p>For he really is the most sentimental of asses. Sentiment
and temper are the two outlets for the uneducated. They
are his. Convince the Great American Ass that his behaviour
is callous, capricious, cruel, and he&#8217;d asphyxiate his
victim in sentimental saliva.</p>

<p>For this secretion foams up from the Centre of Population
and oozes in all directions. It is the solvent for the repulsive,
the ugly, the sordid, offered in the pill of Art by
Modernism.</p>

<p>But what, exactly, this pill is going to do to the Great
American Ass is still a social and pathological problem.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Annan was up to his neck in saliva. That great army of
slight acquaintances with which the average man is afflicted
became old friends over night.</p>

<p>Annan was running the whole gamut from these, and
from readers utterly unknown to him. Every mail brought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
requests for loans, autographs, and for personal assistance
of various sorts; and there were endless charitable appeals,
offers to lecture, offers of election to clubs, guilds, associations,
societies he never heard of; requests for his patronage,
his endorsement of saleable articles; requests for criticism
upon the myriad efforts of unsuccessful writers; demands
that he should &#8220;place&#8221; their effusions; personal calls from
agents, publishers, cranks.</p>

<p>And there was, of course, a great influx of silliness&mdash;flirtatious
letters, passionate love letters, sentimental requests
for signed photographs. And among these, as always,
were offensive letters, repulsive letters, sinister and
usually anonymous. The entire gamut.</p>

<p>Toward him there was a new and flattering attitude, even
in old friends, and no matter how honest and sincere, even
in those who disapproved his work, this unconscious attitude
toward a publicly successful man was noticeable.</p>

<p>Otherwise, in public, his face and name were becoming
sufficiently well known to attract curiosity.</p>

<p>In shops clerks would smirk and inquire, &#8220;Mr. Annan, the
novelist?&#8221; Proprietors and underlings in his accustomed
haunts were likely to point him out to other customers. He
was becoming accustomed to being stared at.</p>

<p>Now, some of these phenomena are anything but agreeable
to the newly successful; but, <i>en masse</i>, these manifestations
are not calculated to inculcate steadiness and modesty
in anybody.</p>

<p>A thousand times Annan had told himself that no success
could ever unbalance him a fraction of one degree. But
success is an insidious fever. One walks with it without
suspecting the infection. Without knowing that three-quarters
of the people who shake one&#8217;s hand are carriers of this
same and subtle fever.</p>

<p>However, Barry Annan appeared to thrive. All was well
with him. All was going &#8220;according to plan.&#8221;</p>

<p>His newest novel, scarcely begun, promised dazzlingly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
He was eager, always, to get at it. That was a most excellent
sign. He even preferred writing it to doing anything
else. Another good sign.</p>

<p>Otherwise all was well with him, and going well.</p>

<p>His love affairs, always verbal ones, distracted him agreeably
and were useful professionally. Easily, as always, he
slipped out of one into another with no discomfort to himself
and only a brief but deeper pang for the girl.</p>

<p>Few of these mildly amourous episodes resulted in anything
except a rather more agreeable and care-free friendship,&mdash;as
in the cases of Betsy Blythe and Rosalind Shore.
Disillusioned they liked him better but in a different way.</p>

<p>Probably Eris would, too, when she returned from the
Coast,&mdash;if ever she did return.</p>

<p>Thus, without effort, he reassured himself concerning
her three unanswered letters. His was the gayest and most
optimistic of consciences,&mdash;a little gem of altruism. Per
se it functioned beautifully. He never meddled. It ran
like a watch ticking cheerily.</p>

<p>But it never had had anything serious to deal with. How
heavy a weight it might sustain there was no knowing.</p>

<p>In light marching order his conscience had guided him
very nicely, so far. How would it steer him when it carried
weight?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was early in June that he encountered Coltfoot by
chance. They had not met in months.</p>

<p>Coltfoot did not look shabby nor even wilted, but he wore
last year&#8217;s summer clothes and straw hat, and his dark,
rather grim features seemed thinner.</p>

<p>Annan insisted that they lunch together at the Province
Club. They did. Their respective reports revealed their
situations since they last had met; Annan had only success
to recapitulate,&mdash;Coltfoot a cordial and sincerely happy
listener.</p>

<p>But it had gone otherwise with Coltfoot. When he resigned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
from the <i>Planet</i> because his self-respect couldn&#8217;t
tolerate its policy, the business situation was not such as to
make job hunting easy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Outside of any salary I&#8217;ve income enough to live on
rather rottenly,&#8221; he remarked, &#8220;but I don&#8217;t want to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean you haven&#8217;t a job, Mike?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ve got one&mdash;one of those stinking magazines which
can be bought any day and which always are being &#8216;revived&#8217;
by &#8216;new blood.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m supposed to be that fresh and sanguinary reservoir.
We may file a petition in bankruptcy or continue. There&#8217;s
no telling.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What an outrage! A man of your calibre&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry. Somewhere in dusty perspective the job
I&#8217;m destined to nab is lumbering along the highway of life.
I&#8217;ll hold it up when it tries to pass by me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know, Mike, that if ever you&#8217;re short&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks.... No fear. What sort of fodder do you
next hand out to your famishing public?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m preparing it.... You won&#8217;t like it, Mike.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Same graft?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean, graft&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You poor fish, are you touchy already?&#8221;</p>

<p>Annan reddened very slightly, then laughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Kick my pants hard if ever I&#8217;m <i>that</i>, Mike. May the
Lord defend me from solemnity and smugness!... Mike,
I wish we could see more of each other.... Things worry
me a lot sometimes. A fellow has got to believe in himself,
yet complacency is destruction.... All this&mdash;you know
what I mean&mdash;disconcerts a man.... I admit it. It&#8217;s
come to a point where actually I don&#8217;t know whether my
stuff is worth immortality, or a tinker&#8217;s dam, or zero.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet I feel I <i>can</i> deliver the hootch.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hootch all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;God knows.... Like the Mad Hatter&mdash;or was
it the Rabbit?&mdash;I&#8217;ve used the best ingredient.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>&#8220;There were crumbs in it,&#8221; said Coltfoot. &#8220;Besides,
wood-alcohol isn&#8217;t a lubricant.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus from simile to allegory, to inference via insinuation&mdash;discourse
in terms possible only between old friends of
different species born in the same culture among fellow
bacilli of their period.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hang it all,&#8221; insisted Annan, &#8220;the world isn&#8217;t swimming
in syrup!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor in vinegar, Barry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t see the sugar-candy aspect of a story,&#8221; said Annan.
&#8220;All that lovey-lovey-sweetie-sweetie goo is as dead
as Cleopatra.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There <i>was</i> a Cleopatra. And she loved. There <i>was</i>
beauty, brilliancy, ardour, wit, gaiety, pleasure&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&mdash;<i>And</i> the asp!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but why star the asp? It bit only once. Why devote
the whole story to ominous apprehension, the relentless
approach of horror from beyond vast horizons? There
were long intervals of sunlight and song in Cleopatra&#8217;s day.
Why make of your book a monograph on poisons? Why
turn it into a history of the asp? Why minutely construct a
treatise on serpents?</p>

<p>&#8220;Good Lord, Barry, when you&#8217;ve a good dinner served
you at home, why slink to the nearest ash-can and rummage
for putrid bones?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;After all, there <i>are</i> a few million garbage cans in the
world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Their contents are not nourishing. Why not leave such
scraps to the degenerates so well known to the medical gentlemen
who specialize in them?&mdash;to the Gauguins, Cezannes,
Matisses among professors and students in that ghastly
clinic where subject, operator and onlooker are scarcely
distinguishable to the normal eye?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good heavens, what bitterness!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good God, what insanity!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must hew out my own way&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; insisted Annan hotly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>&#8220;Hew on! But follow the standard! Don&#8217;t lose sight
of the standard&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Standards change&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not The Cross!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a silence; then Barry said: &#8220;Is it the function
of art to make people better by lying to them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not its function to make them worse by offering
distorted truths.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does it hurt people to know the truer and less pleasant
side of life?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; but it hurts them to dwell on it. That&#8217;s what modernism
makes them do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Life is nine-tenths unpleasant.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then say so in a line. And in the rest of your story try
to help people to endure those nine-tenths by forgetting
them while they read about the other tenth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to mutilate truth,&#8221; retorted Annan.</p>

<p>&#8220;You <i>do</i> mutilate it. The school that influences you
mutilates truth as was mutilated the body of Osiris! The
school that stains you with its shadow is a school of mutilators.
I&#8217;m not squeamish, Barry. I&#8217;m for plain writing.
The truths leered at or slurred over or ignored by convention
can be decently presented in proportion to their importance
in any story.</p>

<p>&#8220;But satyrism in art, the satanism that worships ugliness,
the perversion that twists, distorts, mutilates the human
body, the human mind, nature, the only flawless masterpiece,&mdash;no,
I&#8217;m not for these. I tell you that the entire modernist
movement is but a celebration of The Black Mass. Crazy
and sane, <i>that</i> is what the leaders in this school are doing.
Their god is Anti-Christ; their ritual destruction. And I
do not believe that Christ, all merciful, will ever say to the
least guilty among these&mdash;&#8216;Absolvo te.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a long silence. Finally Annan said: &#8220;On your
side you are more savage than I on mine. I am no missionary&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>&#8220;<i>I</i> am. The human being who is not is negligible. I tell
you that beauty is good and right. It is salvation. It is the
goal. And I tell you that the use of evil is to throw beauty
in brighter, more perfect relief. That is its <i>only</i> use in art.</p>

<p>&#8220;And it never should be the theme, nor bask in the spotlight,
nor centre the composition. All its arrows point inward
to that one divine and ultimate spot&mdash;the touch of
highest value in Rembrandt&#8217;s canvasses&mdash;the supreme pinpoint
of clarity and glory&mdash;Beauty&mdash;symmetrical, flawless,
eternal.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As they left the club together: &#8220;Almost thou persuadest
me,&#8221; said Annan lightly.</p>

<p>Parting, they shook hands: &#8220;No, not I,&#8221; said Coltfoot.
&#8220;Some sorrow will do that.... Or some woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>Annan turned down Fifth Avenue much amused.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">EARLY in June Rosalind Shore celebrated the 365th performance
of her musical comedy.</p>

<p>She got Annan on the telephone just as he was leaving
his house to dine wherever fancy suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Harry Sneyd is giving a supper dance for me,&#8221; she explained,
&#8220;and he wants a bunch of names that will look well
in to-morrow&#8217;s papers. Do you mind coming, Barry? Or
have you become too darned great to let the public suspect
that you know how to frivol?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pity your mother didn&#8217;t spank the sarcasm out of you
while she was getting busy,&#8221; he retorted. &#8220;Where is the
frivolling and what time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You nice boy! It&#8217;s after the show in the directors&#8217; suite
at <i>The Looking Glass</i>. Harry&#8217;s a director there, also. Mr.
Shill let him have the suite. Thank you so much, Barry; I
do want all the celebrities I can get, and our publicity department
will be grateful to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Glad you feel that way,&#8221; he said drily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ducky, it does sound like a poor relation touching the
Family Hope; but I love you anyway and you know it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughed, hung up, and went his way. Only the florists
at the great hotels remained open for business. At one of
these he was properly robbed, but the flowers that he sent
to Rosalind were magnificent.</p>

<p>He joined half a dozen men of his own world at the
Province Club and made one of a group at dinner.</p>

<p>Conversation was the sort of big-town-small-talk passing
current as conversation at the majority of such clubs&mdash;Wall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
Street tattle, social prattle, golfing week-ends, summer
plans.</p>

<p>Somebody&mdash;Wilkes Bruce&mdash;remarked to Annan that his
aunt was in town.</p>

<p>The prospect of seeing her cheered him, stirring up that
ever latent perverse humour of his, with the prospect of an
acrimonious exchange of civilities.</p>

<p>Not that Mrs. Magnelius Grandcourt ever received her
nephew willingly; but twice every year matters concerning
the estate had to be discussed with him personally.</p>

<p>So Annan knew that before she took herself elsewhere a
summons to the presence would arrive for him at No. 3
Governor&#8217;s Place.</p>

<p>She possessed a horrible house in town&mdash;a caricature of
a French ch&acirc;teau&mdash;closed most of the year.</p>

<p>In the depths of that dim and over-upholstered stronghold
these semi-annual audiences were held. They resembled
courts of justice, his aunt sitting, and he the malefactor on
parole, reporting at intervals according to law. And he
looked forward to these conferences with malicious amusement,
if his aunt did not.</p>

<p>After dinner he played cowboy pool with Archie Mallison
and Wilkes Bruce, winning as usual. For he did everything
with the same facility that characterised his easy speech and
manners&mdash;accurate without effort, naturally a technician,
always graceful.</p>

<p>But a little of his own caste went a long way with Annan.
Conversation at The Province, as well as at The Patroons,
bored him very soon. So, having neatly disposed of Bruce
and Mallison, he retired to the library&mdash;the only place he
cared about in any club except when some old foozle went to
sleep there and snored.</p>

<p>For an hour he dawdled among the great masters of written
English, always curious, always charmed, unconsciously
aware of a kinship between these immortals and himself.</p>

<p>For perhaps this young man was not unrelated, distantly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
to that noble fellowship, though the subtle possibility had
never entered his mind.</p>

<p>So he dallied among pages printed when writing was a
fine art&mdash;and printing and binding, too; and about midnight
he went below, put on his hat, and betook himself to <i>The
Looking Glass</i>.</p>

<p>In the amusement district the tide of gaiety was still
ebbing with the usual back-wash toward cabaret and midnight
show.</p>

<p><i>The Looking Glass</i> was dark and all doors closed, but
there were many cars in waiting and a group of gossiping
chauffeurs around the private entrance, where a gilded lamp
burned.</p>

<p>Through this entrance he sauntered; a lift shot him upward;
he disembarked amid a glare of light and a jolly
tumult of string-music and laughter.</p>

<p>Somebody took his hat and stick and he walked into the
directors&#8217; suite of <i>The Looking Glass</i>.</p>

<p>There were a lot of people dancing in the handsome board-room&mdash;flowers,
palms, orchestra&mdash;all the usual properties.</p>

<p>The supper room adjoining was gay with jewels and
dinner-gowns, clink of silver, tinkle of glass, speeding of
waiters flying like black shuttles through some rainbow
fabric in the making.</p>

<p>Near the door a girl&mdash;one of a group&mdash;turned as he
strolled up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Barry!&#8221; she exclaimed, and saluted him in Rialto fashion,
with both arms on his shoulders and a typical district
kiss.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you for my flowers, ducky,&#8221; added Rosalind,
&#8220;and you&#8217;re a darling to come. Here&#8217;s Betsy, by the
way&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Betsy!&#8221; he said, taking her outstretched hands,
&#8220;when did you arrive from the Coast?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yesterday, my dear, and never was I so glad to see this
wretched old town. To hear Californians talk you&#8217;d think<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
you were buying a ticket to the Coast of Paradise. But I
notice the Californians remain here&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; She took him
by both arms: &#8220;The same boy. You don&#8217;t <i>look</i> great. Do
you <i>feel</i> very great, dear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps His Greatness needs food to look the part,&#8221;
suggested Rosalind. &#8220;Don&#8217;t get us any,&#8221; she added, as he
turned to pay his devoirs to the others in the group.</p>

<p>He shook hands with Harry Sneyd, bowed to Wally Crawford,
encountered the mischievous gaze of Nancy Cassell,
and paid his respects to her with gay cordiality.</p>

<p>There were other people, but the flow to and fro between
supper and dance cut them off. He noticed Leopold Shill,
very shiny, and exchanged a perfectly polite salute with him.
Beyond, the thinning black hair and sanguine face of Albert
Smull were visible amid groups continually forming and disintegrating.</p>

<p>It came into Annan&#8217;s mind that Eris also must have returned
from the Coast; and he turned and made the inquiry
of Rosalind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, yes, she&#8217;s here somewhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Probably where the men are thickest,&#8221; drawled Rosalind.
&#8220;If you see a large crowd,&mdash;and a burgundy flush,&mdash;that&#8217;s
the suitors of Eris,&mdash;and Albert Smull; and you&#8217;ll find Eris
in the centre of it all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Annan laughed and strolled on. For Smull he had no
enthusiasm. As for Eris, when he thought of her he felt
cordially toward her. But there was now an uneasy and increasing
sense of his own neglect to subdue any spontaneous
pleasure in meeting her. It annoyed him to feel that he had
been guilty of neglect. Until that moment he had not felt
any particular shortcoming.</p>

<p>A girl he knew came drifting out of the throng&mdash;one of
his many and meaningless affinities. They always were glad
to see him after the storm and stress of the verbal love affair.
So she drifted away in his arms&mdash;one of the recent steps&mdash;picked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
up by him without effort&mdash;and they danced the thing
out.</p>

<p>Some man took her off. But there were others&mdash;plenty&mdash;all
sorts. He danced enough to amuse him, thinking most of
the time about his new story, and now and then of Eris.</p>

<p>Several times the ruddy features of Smull cut his rather
hazy line of vision; but he didn&#8217;t discover anybody resembling
Eris in the vicinity.</p>

<p>He had handed his latest partner over to Frank Donnell,
and had swung on his heel to avoid a large group of people.
And at that moment he saw Eris.</p>

<p>The sheer beauty of the girl startled him, and it was an
appreciable moment before he realised that her grey eyes
were encountering his.</p>

<p>Annan seldom reddened. He did now. He was not certain,
either, but that she was administering a cut direct,
because there was no recognition in the grey eyes, no
smile.</p>

<p>There were a number of men standing about between
them; he hesitated to invite the full snub he deserved. Then
he saw her silently disengage herself from the group about
her and start directly toward him.</p>

<p>That galvanised him into action&mdash;rather brusquely&mdash;for
he brushed a few stalwart shoulders as he caught the hand
she extended in both of his.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t we find some quiet place&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; she said unsteadily.</p>

<p>He drew her arm through his and they made their way in
silence across the floor toward a vista of offices now banked
with palms and flowers and invaded by the few who courted
seclusion and each other.</p>

<p>A girl and a man gave them an unfriendly look as they
entered the last of the offices, and presently took themselves
off.</p>

<p>Eris glanced absently at the chairs they had vacated, then
released her arm, turned and walked slowly to the embrasure
of the window.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>When he came to her she made a little gesture;&mdash;he
waited.</p>

<p>After a while: &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t control my voice,&#8221; she said....
&#8220;I am so happy to see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>For the first time in his life, perhaps, speech stuck in his
glib throat.</p>

<p>She said: &#8220;I wondered if you were going to be here. Are
you quite well? You seem so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you Eris?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes;&mdash;tired, though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are successful. I&#8217;ve heard that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have very much to learn, Mr. Annan.... There
seems to be no end to study.... But there is no other
pleasure or excitement comparable to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you still hot on the trail of Truth?&#8221; he ventured with
a forced smile.</p>

<p>She laughed frankly: &#8220;Yes, and do you know that hunting
truth doesn&#8217;t seem to be a popular sport?&#8221; Then, more
seriously: &#8220;Of what value is anything else, Mr. Annan?
Why isn&#8217;t truth more popular? Could you tell me
why?&#8221;</p>

<p>The old, remembered cry of Eris&mdash;&#8220;Could you tell me
<i>why?</i>&#8221;&mdash;was sounding in his ears again&mdash;the same wistful,
familiar question.</p>

<p>If Annan had now regained his native equanimity it was
entirely due to this girl who had not even deigned to admit
any awkwardness in their encounter. And he realised, gratefully,
that she was continuing to ignore any lesser detail
than the happy fact of reunion.</p>

<p>&#8220;So that&#8217;s your idea of happiness?&#8221; he said, gratefully
reassured.</p>

<p>&#8220;It always was. I told you so long ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I remember.&#8221; He looked at her, ashamed and sorry that
he had had no active part in this charming fruition. Or,
rather, it was as yet merely a delicate promise with blossoms
still chastely folded. No flower yet.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>&#8220;It&#8217;s plain enough,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that you&#8217;ve never lost a
moment in self-improvement since you went away nearly a
year ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Being with Betsy taught me so much. And Frank Donnell
is so wise and gentle.... But <i>you</i> began it all&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Began what?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;I told you that you were the first man of <i>your</i> kind I
had ever met. That night&mdash;in the Park&mdash;it was just exactly
as though I had gone to sleep deaf, dumb, and blind, and
waked up possessed of every faculty&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re loyal to the point of obstinacy,&#8221; he interrupted.
&#8220;You owe absolutely nothing to me. All I did was to fail
you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t say that, Mr. Annan; you&mdash;annoy me when
you do&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t believe in you. I deserted you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please&mdash;you <i>hurt</i> me&mdash;when you speak that way&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t even continue to write&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You were too busy with important things&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eris! Are you really going to overlook my rotten behaviour?&#8221;</p>

<p>They both had become nervously excited, although their
voices were low. Her protesting hand hesitated toward his
arm; his fists were clenched in his pockets,&mdash;effort at self
restraint:</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re so square and decent,&#8221; he said. &#8220;When I saw
you I realised what a rotter I&#8217;d been. You ought to have
cut me dead to-night&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she said with a swift intake of breath and her
hovering hand a moment on his arm.</p>

<p>After a long silence: &#8220;All right,&#8221; he said almost grimly.
He looked up, laughed: &#8220;I&#8217;m yours, Eris. Everybody else
seems to be, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her face, clearing, flushed swiftly, and she gave him a
confused look.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shan&#8217;t tease,&#8221; he said,&mdash;back on the old footing in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
twinkling, &#8220;&mdash;but you do seem to be popular with people.
Isn&#8217;t it a rather agreeable feeling?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.... I want to tell you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; She hesitated,
laughed hopelessly. &#8220;I&#8217;m so excited, Mr. Annan, I don&#8217;t
know how to begin. Why, the things I have to tell you&mdash;and
the things I have to ask you&mdash;would take a year to
utter&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All the time you&#8217;ve been away?&#8221; he inquired gaily.</p>

<p>&#8220;That must be it. Every day they accumulated. I
needed you....&#8221; She checked herself, breathless, smiling,
the colour bright in her cheeks. &#8220;All you have done and
are doing,&#8221; she said, half to herself, &#8220;I have so longed to
hear about. All I have tried to do I was crazy to tell you
about.... And now&mdash;I can&#8217;t think&mdash;remember&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We must make another engagement.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please!... I was so unhappy about the other one&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What hour can you give me, Eris?&#8221;</p>

<p>To <i>give</i> had been <i>his</i> perquisite heretofore. She seemed
to so consider it, still.</p>

<p>&#8220;Could you spare me a little time to-morrow?&#8221; she asked,
almost timidly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you dine with me?&#8221;</p>

<p>She said na&iuml;vely: &#8220;Couldn&#8217;t we see each other before to-morrow
night? It seems so long&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The swift charm of her impatience surprised and touched
him. Again this young man was rapidly losing his balance
in the girl&#8217;s candour.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whenever you care to see me,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll come....
Any day, any hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>She said, with surprise and emotion: &#8220;You are very kind
to me, Mr. Annan. You always have been&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is you who are kind. You seem unconscious of your
own generosity. Will you come to see me, or shall I come
to you, Eris?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know,&#8221; she explained with happy animation, &#8220;I&#8217;ve
taken the entire floor where I had my room in Jane Street.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
It would be quite all right for you to come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;Tea?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;that&#8217;s not very early&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;After lunch, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You <i>could</i> come to breakfast,&#8221; she said with a half shy,
half laughing glance. &#8220;I was born on a farm and I rise very
early. You do, too&mdash;I remember&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You friendly girl! You bet I&#8217;ll come!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hate to waste time in sleep,&#8221; she added, still shy and
smiling.... &#8220;What do you like for breakfast, Mr. Annan?&mdash;Oh,
I remember. Mrs. Sniffen told me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You surely can&#8217;t recollect&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I do.... Do you think I could ever forget anything
that happened there?... You breakfast at
eight&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; She laughed with sheer delight: &#8220;That is going
to be wonderful, Mr. Annan&mdash;to be able to offer you breakfast
in my own apartment!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And we lunch at the Ritz and dine at my house,&#8221; he
added.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wonderful! Wonderful! And I <i>can</i> accept, because I
have&mdash;proper clothes! Isn&#8217;t it perfectly enchanting&mdash;the
way it all has turned out?&#8221;</p>

<p>That he was quite conscious of the enchantment appeared
plain enough to people who chanced to enter the room where
they stood together in the recess of the open window.</p>

<p>Several of the men so recently bereaved of Eris evinced
an inclination to hover about the vicinity. Once or twice
Annan was aware of black hair and ruddy features in the
offing&mdash;a glimpse of Albert Smull, passing, elaborately
oblivious.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must tell you,&#8221; said Eris, making no effort to conceal
regret, &#8220;that there&#8217;s a business matter I shall have to attend
to in a few minutes. Rosalind insists that the announcement
be made this evening. It&#8217;s a great secret, but I&#8217;ll tell
you: I&#8217;m going to have my own company!&#8221;</p>

<p>She gave him her hands, laughing, excited by his astonishment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
and the ardour of his impetuous congratulations.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it too splendid! I can scarcely believe it, Mr.
Annan. But in our last picture it came to a point where
Betsy thought we were, perhaps, interfering with each other&mdash;I
mean that&mdash;that&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eris flushed: &#8220;Betsy was so sweet and generous about it.
But I, somehow, realised that I&#8217;d have to go.... It was
right that I should.... And I had a talk with Frank Donnell....
I don&#8217;t know who told Mr. Smull about it, but he
telegraphed that he was coming out. He came with Mr.
Shill.... That was how it happened. Mr. Smull offered
me my company. I was thunderstruck, Mr. Annan&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You would be, you modest child. It&#8217;s splendid!&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
He kept continually forcing out of his mind the fact of
Smull&#8217;s part in the matter. &#8220;It&#8217;s an astonishing tribute to
your talent and character, Eris. Who is your director?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Creevy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Ratford Creevy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Emil Shunk is our camera-man. Mr. Creevy
brings his staff with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Annan had his opinion of Mr. Creevy, but kept it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he repeated, &#8220;that&#8217;s splendid, Eris. I&#8217;m astonished,&mdash;you
wanted me to be, didn&#8217;t you?&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;&mdash;I&#8217;m astounded. And I&#8217;m just as happy as you are&mdash;you
nice, fine girl!&mdash;you clever, clever kiddie!&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>They were laughing without reserve, her slim hands still
clasped in his; and both turned without embarrassment
when Rosalind came leisurely behind them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Albert has been chewing his moustache for half an
hour,&#8221; she drawled. &#8220;Are you actually spooning, Eris?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How silly! Does Mr. Smull want me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re all set. Leo Shill is to announce it. You&#8217;re to
group with Albert and Ratty Creevy and receive bouquets.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
Come, Eris; let that young man&#8217;s educated hands alone&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Eris, unconscious until then that Annan still retained her
hands, withdrew them without embarrassment. Rosalind
passed a beautifully plump arm around her waist, letting her
amused glance linger on Annan:</p>

<p>&#8220;The immaculate lover,&#8221; she drawled, &#8220;always busy.&#8221;
And to Eris: &#8220;You&#8217;ll like him better, though, after it&#8217;s all
over,&mdash;after the teething, my dear. We all bite on Barry.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap2">ANNAN spent the entire day with Eris; came home at
midnight; seated himself at his desk where his work
lay in inviting disorder.</p>

<p>But there was no more chance of his working than there
was of his sleeping.</p>

<p>It was the first time it ever had happened. He could not
remember an instance when the subtle challenge of a disordered
manuscript had been declined by him.</p>

<p>But something had happened to this young man. He was
in no condition to realise what. His mind, that hitherto
faithful ally, seemed incompetent; trivial thoughts thronged
its corridors, wandering ideas, irrelevant impressions drifted
in agreeable rhythm.</p>

<p>There was a letter from his aunt on his desk. He tore it
open; glanced through it without the usual grin; laid it
aside.</p>

<p>A slight, rather vacant smile remained on his lips: he kept
moving the lapel of his coat and inhaling the odour of a
white clove-pink&mdash;one of a cluster that had stood in a little
rose-bowl between Eris and himself at breakfast.</p>

<p>A pencil, dislodged, rolled over his pad and dropped onto
the floor. He let it lie.</p>

<p>Neither work nor sleep attracted him. From the oddly
pleasant sense of chaos in his mind always something more
definite and more pleasant seemed about to take shape and
emerge.</p>

<p>Whatever it was had delicately saturated him: all his being
seemed permeated, possessed with the spell of it.</p>

<p>Time after time his mind mechanically began that day<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
again, drifted through the sequence of events, minute by
minute, leading him at length to where he now was seated,&mdash;but
only to recommence again from the beginning.</p>

<p>About two o&#8217;clock he fell asleep, his boyish nose touching
the clove-pink. When his head sagged to a more uncomfortable
position he awoke, got out of his clothes and went
to sleep in the proper place.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The first thing he did after he awoke was to unhook the
telephone receiver:</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it you, Eris?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then a perfectly damning sequence of solicitous inquiries&mdash;the
regulation and inevitable gamut concerning the young
lady&#8217;s health, night&#8217;s repose, condition of mind, physical
symptoms. Followed a voluntary statement regarding the
day before and his intense pleasure in it; then a diffident
inquiry, and a hope expressed that she, also, might have
found the day not insupportably unpleasant;&mdash;surprise and
pleasure to learn that she, too, had considered the day &#8220;wonderful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Could I see you to-day?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>But she had her hands full, it appeared.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try to get away after dinner,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Would you
telephone about nine-thirty, Mr. Annan?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a long time&mdash;all right, then!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I may not be able to get away,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let me spoil your evening&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had <i>rather</i> be with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fluency seemed no longer his: &#8220;That&#8217;s&mdash;that&#8217;s jolly of
you&mdash;awfully nice of you, Eris,&mdash;most kind.... I&#8217;ll call
your apartment at nine-thirty, if I may.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I can&#8217;t get away,&#8221; she said, &#8220;could we see each other
to-morrow?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At <i>any</i> hour, Eris!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;your work&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s quite all right. I can always fit that in.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>&#8220;You shouldn&#8217;t. You should fit <i>me</i> in&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But <i>I</i> shall have to do that, too, when we begin
work&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand that. When may I see you to-morrow, if
you can&#8217;t see me this evening?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you come to tea?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, if I can&#8217;t come earlier.&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed&mdash;a distant, gay little laugh&mdash;a new sound
from her lips, born quite unexpectedly the day before to
surprise them both.</p>

<p>&#8220;You make our friendship so easy,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You quite
reverse conditions. I&#8217;m happy and <i>grateful</i> that you are
coming to tea&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>His unconsidered and somewhat impetuous reply seemed
to confuse Eris. There was a silence, then:</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the truth,&#8221; he repeated; &#8220;&mdash;it <i>is</i> a privilege to be
with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her voice came, a little wistful, yet humourously incredulous:</p>

<p>&#8220;You say such kind things, Mr. Annan.... Thank
you.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>With a buoyant sense of having begun the day right,
Annan took a noisy bath, ate every scrap of breakfast, and
sat down before his desk in lively spirits, when Mrs. Sniffen
had finished with his quarters.</p>

<p>&#8220;Xantippe,&#8221; he said gaily, &#8220;do you know that little Miss
Odell has become a very clever and promising professional?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That baby, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That child. What do you think of that, Xantippe?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Sniffen&#8217;s countenance became grim:</p>

<p>&#8220;I &#8217;ope that God may guide her, Mr. Barry,&mdash;for there&#8217;s
devils a-plenty hunting out such jobs.&#8221;</p>

<p>He said: &#8220;She&#8217;s turned out rather a wonderful sort,
Xantippe. Sometimes beginners do make good in such a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
short time. I&#8217;ve known one or two instances. I&#8217;ve heard
of others. Usually there&#8217;s disaster as an aftermath. They&#8217;re
people who were born to do that one thing <i>once</i>. Nothing
else. They&#8217;re rockets. Their capacity is emptied in one
dazzling flare-up.</p>

<p>&#8220;A burnt-out brain remains.... There&#8217;s no tragedy like
it.... Consistent failure is less cruel.</p>

<p>&#8220;But this girl isn&#8217;t like that. I&#8217;m satisfied. She&#8217;s merely
starting. She&#8217;s modest, honest, intelligent. You and I bear
witness to her courage. And there seems to be no question
about her talent.... It seems to be one of those instances
where circumstance plays second fiddle to Destiny.&#8221;</p>

<p>He picked up the faded clove-pink, looked at it absently,
laid it upon his desk.</p>

<p>&#8220;So &#8216;that&#8217;s that,&#8217; as she says sometimes.&#8221; He looked up
smilingly at Mrs. Sniffen, then his smile degenerated into a
grin: &#8220;Aunt Cornelia is in town. I&#8217;m lunching there.&#8221;</p>

<p>At one o&#8217;clock Annan sauntered up to the limestone portal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, Jennings,&#8221; he said genially to a large, severe man
who opened the door,&mdash;&#8220;the three most annoying things in
the world are death, hay-fever, and nephews. The last are
worst, because more frequent. Kindly prepare Mrs. Grandcourt.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was already in the drawing-room. She offered him
the celebrated hand once compared to Queen Victoria&#8217;s. He
saluted the accustomed pearl&mdash;the black one:</p>

<p>&#8220;Madame my Aunt, your most obedient&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Her butler, Seaman, announced luncheon with the reverence
of a Second-Adventist. Annan offered his arm to the
dumpy old woman.</p>

<p>Only her thin, high-bridged, arrogant nose redeemed her
features of a retired charwoman. Watery eyes inspected
him across the table; a little withered chin tucked between
dewlaps, a sagging, discontented mouth, a mottled skin,
concluded the ensemble.</p>

<p>White lace collar and cuffs turned over the black gown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
did what was sartorially possible for Mrs. Magnelius Grandcourt.
Otherwise, the famous string of cherry-sized pearls
dangled to what should have been her waist.</p>

<p>&#8220;It appears,&#8221; she said, &#8220;that you still inhabit your alley.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Barry-in-our-alley,&#8221; he said cheerfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;When are you going to move to a suitable neighbourhood?&#8221;
she inquired with that peculiar pitch of tone usually,
in her sex, indicative of displeasure.</p>

<p>&#8220;I like to be quaint,&#8221; he explained, grinning.</p>

<p>After a pause and a shift to the next course: &#8220;<i>I</i> don&#8217;t
know where you get your taste for squalour,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;You didn&#8217;t inherit it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t one of our ancestors haunt bar-maids?&#8221; he enquired
guilelessly. &#8220;I always understood that was where we
acquired our bar-sinister&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, Barry,&#8221; she said sharply; sat staring at him in a
cold rage that Seaman&#8217;s ears should have been polluted by
such a pleasantry.</p>

<p>Annan&#8217;s interior was riotous with laughter and his features
crimsoned with it. But he only gazed inquiringly at
his aunt; and the wretched incident waned.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>They went into the library after luncheon. A secretary
brought the necessary papers.</p>

<p>Annan&#8217;s was a cheerful nature. There was no greed in it.
In all questions, that might properly have become disputes
concerning joint income and investment, he yielded good
humouredly to her.</p>

<p>There was a more vulgar streak than thrift in Mrs. Magnelius
Grandcourt. The majority of rich are infected with it.</p>

<p>However, family matters settled to her satisfaction, she
seemed inclined to a more friendly attitude.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was very impudent of you to send me that New
York Directory,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but I suppose you intended it to
be a pleasantry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, no,&#8221; he said innocently, &#8220;I thought it would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
gratify you to discover so many people you didn&#8217;t care to
know&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Barry! I see nothing humorous in it. Do you think the
breaking down of society is humorous?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it breaking down?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do I need to answer you? What has become of the old
barriers that kept out undesirables? <i>Once</i> there was a society
in New York. Is there to-day? No, Barry;&mdash;only a
fragment here and there.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only a few houses left where we rally. This house,
thank God, is one of them. And while <i>I</i> live and retain my
faculties, I shall continue to dictate my visiting list, here and
in Newport, and shall properly censor it, despite the unbecoming
mockery of my own flesh and blood&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense, Aunt Cornelia, it&#8217;s only in fun, not ill-natured.
I can&#8217;t take such matters solemnly. Who the devil cares
who you are to-day? It&#8217;s what you <i>do</i>. You&#8217;re no longer a
rarity in an uncouth town. There are too many like you&mdash;quite
as wealthy, cultivated, experienced&mdash;plenty of people
who can give the denizens inhabiting any of the social puddles
a perfectly good time.</p>

<p>&#8220;There isn&#8217;t any society. There never has been a real one
since Washington was President. What passed for it you
helped boss very cleverly. But it gradually swelled and
burst&mdash;like one of those wobbly stars&mdash;scattered into a lot
of brilliant little fragments, each a perfectly good star in
itself&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What you say is utterly absurd,&#8221; interrupted his aunt,
wrathfully. &#8220;By tradition there is and can be only one
society in America. Its accepted rendezvous is in New
York; its arbiters are so by birth. Theirs is an inherited
trust. They are its censors. I shall never violate what I
was born to respect and uphold.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, smiling, &#8220;I suppose you really consider
me a renegade and a low fellow because I entertain the public
with my stories.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>&#8220;A public entertainer has his proper place, Barry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure. On the door-step. That&#8217;s where we once were
told to sit&mdash;authors, players, painters&mdash;the whole job-lot of
us. Now we prefer it, although since your youth society
welcomes anybody that can amuse it. We go in, now and
then. But it&#8217;s better fun outside. So I&#8217;m going to sit there
and tell my stories to the hoi-polloi as they pass along. If
what you consider society wishes to listen it can stick its
head out of the window.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is amazing to me,&#8221; she said, staring at him out of
watery eyes, &#8220;how utterly common my brother&#8217;s son can be.
I can <i>not</i> understand it, Barry. And you are not alone in
this demoralization. Young people everywhere are infected.
Only a week or two ago I met Elizabeth Blythe in California.
She was painted a perfectly ghastly colour in broad daylight.
Elizabeth Blythe&mdash;the daughter of Courtlandt Blythe,
a painted, motion-picture <i>actress</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was impossible for him to control his laughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;She told me that you snubbed her,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But you
don&#8217;t seem to be consistent, Aunt Cornelia. I hear that
you&#8217;ve been civil and kind to another actress. I mean Eris
Odell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do <i>you</i> know her?&#8221; inquired his aunt calmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve met her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Grandcourt remained silent for a while, her pale
eyes fixed on her nephew.</p>

<p>&#8220;That girl&#8217;s grandmother was my beloved comrade in
boarding school,&#8221; she said slowly. &#8220;We shared the same
room. Her name was Jeanne d&#8217;Espremont. Her grandmother
was that celebrated Countess of the time of Louis
XV.... They were Louisiana Creoles. Her blood was as
good as any in France. Probably that means nothing to a
modern young man.... It meant something to me....
I shouldn&#8217;t have wished to love a nobody as I loved Jeanne
d&#8217;Espremont.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Grandcourt bent her head and looked down at her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
celebrated Victorian hands. Pearls bulged on the tiny, fat
fingers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jeanne ran away,&#8221; she said. &#8220;She married the son of a
planter. His family was unimpeachable, but he looked like a
fox. When he drank himself to death she went on the
stage.</p>

<p>&#8220;She had a baby. I saw it. It looked like a female fox.
Jeanne died when the girl was sixteen.... I&#8217;d have taken
her,&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Presently Annan asked why she hadn&#8217;t done so.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; said his aunt, &#8220;she married a boy who peddled
vegetables the day after the funeral. His name was Odell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! Was he the father of Eris?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was. And is.... What an astonishing reversion
to the lovely, aristocratic type of her grandmother.... I
encountered her by accident. She was with Elizabeth
Blythe, but she was not painted.... I assure you, Barry,
it was a severe shock to me. She is the absolute image of her
grandmother.... She startled me so.... I never was
emotional.... But&mdash;I could scarcely speak&mdash;scarcely find
my voice&mdash;to ask her.... But I <i>knew</i>. The girl was
Jeanne d&#8217;Espremont, <i>alive</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>After a moment: &#8220;Did you find her interesting?&#8221; he
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;She has all the charm and intelligence of her grandmother....
And all her lovely appeal. And her fatal
obstinacy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Obstinacy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.... I told her about her grandmother. I asked
her to give up her profession and come to me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Mrs.
Grandcourt&#8217;s features grew red:&mdash;&#8220;I offered to stand her
sponsor, educate her properly, give her the position in the
younger set to which her blood entitled her.... I offered
to endow her, Barry.... I think now you understand how
I loved her grandmother.&#8221;</p>

<p>The idea of his aunt parting willingly with a penny so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
amazed and entranced the young man that he merely gazed
at her incapable of comment.</p>

<p>His aunt rose,&mdash;signal that the audience was ended. Annan
got up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that she declined to give up her
profession for such a prospect?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not only that,&#8221; replied his aunt, getting redder, &#8220;but she
refused to accept a dollar.... And she hasn&#8217;t a penny except
her salary. That is like her grandmother, never permitting
a favour that she could not return.... Jeanne
was poor, compared to me, Barry&mdash;my little comrade, Jeanne
d&#8217;Espremont.... I loved her ... dearly....&#8221;</p>

<p>Annan coolly put both arms around his aunt and kissed
her&mdash;a thing that had not occurred since he was in college.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll drop in for tea before you beat it to Newport,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;Then you tell me some more about Jeanne d&#8217;Espremont.&#8221;</p>

<p>He gave her another hearty smack and went out gaily,
leaving Mrs. Magnelius Grandcourt with glassy, astonished
eyes, and a little, selfish, tucked-in mouth that was slightly
quivering.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE day was warm enough to be uncomfortable. Except
in recesses of parks, New York is never fragrant.
Once it was&mdash;when the odour of lindens filled the Broad-Way
from the Fort to St. Paul&#8217;s. Wild birds sang in every
street. Washington was President. Green leaves and scent
and song are gone where &#8220;The Almond Tree shall flourish,&#8221;
deep planted in the heart of man.</p>

<p>As far as perfume is concerned, neither the eastward
avenues nor cross-streets suggested Araby to Annan. He
carried, as usual, a large pasteboard box full of flowers.</p>

<p>Jane Street runs west out of Greenwich Avenue. Shabby
red brick buildings with rusty fire-escapes, lofts, stables, a
vista of swarming tenements through which runs a sagging
pavement set with pools of water&mdash;and, on the south side,
half a dozen rickety three-story-and-basement houses&mdash;this
is Jane Street.</p>

<p>The little children of the poor shrilled and milled about
him as he threaded his way among push-cart men and trucks
and mounted the low stoop of the house where Eris lived.</p>

<p>It seemed clean enough inside as he climbed the narrow
stairs, man&#339;uvering his big box full of flowers.</p>

<p>He could hear her negro maid-of-all-work busy in the
kitchen as he knocked,&mdash;hear her call out gaily: &#8220;Miss Eris!
Miss Eris, somebody&#8217;s knockin&#8217; an&#8217; I can&#8217;t leave mah
kitchen&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Came the light sound of feet dancing along the hall, the
door jerked open in his face, sudden vision of grey eyes and
bobbed chestnut hair; the swift bright smile:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>&#8220;Good morning!&#8221;&mdash;her offered hand, cool and fresh in
his. &#8220;<i>More</i> flowers? But yesterday&#8217;s flowers are perfectly
fresh! <i>Thank</i> you, Mr. Annan, <i>so</i> much&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She was the most engaging person to give things to&mdash;anything,
no matter how trivial&mdash;and her delight and child-like
lack of restraint were refreshing reward to a young
man accustomed to feminine sophistication.</p>

<p>Any sort of a package excited her, and she lost no time
in opening it.</p>

<p>Now, with her arms full of iris and peonies, she exclaimed
her delight again, again made her personal gratitude a
charming reward out of all proportion to the gift.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;ll turn on the water in the bath-tub,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;I&#8217;ll lay them there until I can find something to put them
in.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was the usual procedure. He had sent her a lot of
inexpensive glass bowls, jars and vases. He now gave the
flowers a bath while she ran to the pantry and came back
with half a dozen receptacles.</p>

<p>Together they arranged the flowers and carried them into
the three rooms of the little apartment which, already, was
blossoming like a Persian garden. And all the while their
desultory chatter continued&mdash;fragments left from their last
parting&mdash;gossip resumed, unasked questions held over and
now remembered, punctuated by the girl&#8217;s unspoiled pleasure
in every blossom that she chose and placed.</p>

<p>Breakfast was ready when they were&mdash;the sort of breakfast
she remembered he liked.</p>

<p>Nothing about Eris seemed to have been spoiled&mdash;least of
all her appetite. He thought it charmingly childish, and it
always amused him. Besides, the girl&#8217;s lovely freshness in
the morning always fascinated him. Only children turned
unblemished faces to the morning in New York.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Together in the cool living-room, after breakfast, they
settled for a happy, busy morning&mdash;the business of exchanging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
thoughts, including vast material for discussion accumulated
over night.</p>

<p>After a year&#8217;s absence, and in the sudden sun-burst of
their reunion, Eris was venturing more and more in the art
of conversation. With Annan, diffidence, shyness were
vanishing in their new and happy intimacy. She was learning
to withhold from him nothing that concerned the things
of the mind. Its pleasures she hastened to surrender to
him; its perplexities she offered him with a wistful candour
that constantly was stirring depths within him hitherto
obscurely stagnant.</p>

<p>All these&mdash;her personality, the physical loveliness of the
girl&mdash;were subtly obsessing him, usurping intellectual routine
when he was away, crowding other thoughts, colouring
his mental process, interfering with its clarity when he
worked&mdash;interrupting charmingly&mdash;as though her light
touch on his sleeve had arrested his pen.</p>

<p>She was asking him now about the progress of his new
novel: he was lighting a cigarette, and he looked up over
the burning match:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an inert lump,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I come in and give it a
kick but it doesn&#8217;t even squirm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; she asked, concerned.</p>

<p>He lighted his cigarette. There was a mischievous glimmer
in his eyes:</p>

<p>&#8220;Probably it&#8217;s sulking because I&#8217;m having a better time
with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not serious!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I am. That fool of a novel is jealous. That&#8217;s
what&#8217;s the matter with it, Eris.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I believed that,&#8221; she said with a troubled smile, &#8220;I&#8217;d
not go near you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That would be murderous, Eris.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I&#8217;d go home and kick that novel to death.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her light laughter was not wholly free of concern:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;ve thought sometimes,&#8221; she said, &#8220;that perhaps our
mornings together might take a little of the freshness <i>out</i>
of you, Mr. Annan.... Take <i>something</i> from your work....
You&#8217;re so nice about it&mdash;but you mustn&#8217;t let me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense. Even if it were true I&#8217;m not going to let
anything spoil our intellectual&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he hesitated,&mdash;&#8220;honeymoon,&#8221;
he added with the faintest malice in his laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a delightful idea!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;That&#8217;s what
this week has been, hasn&#8217;t it!&mdash;on <i>my</i> part, anyway. But
of course you don&#8217;t feel&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do, madam. Do you acknowledge our intellectual alliance?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That settles it. You can&#8217;t honeymoon by yourself, can
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>She thought him delightfully ridiculous. But a faint misgiving
persisted:</p>

<p>&#8220;About your novel,&#8221; she began,&mdash;and he laughed and
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When will you begin again?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How long will our honeymoon last?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That isn&#8217;t fair&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it is. How long, Eris?&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed at his absurdity: &#8220;Forever, with me,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;So you might as well begin work now as later.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hasn&#8217;t our honeymoon interfered a little with your
work?&#8221; he asked lightly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not. It&#8217;s been the most stimulating of tonics,
Mr. Annan.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s overstimulated me, perhaps. I can&#8217;t keep my
feet on the earth,&mdash;I float&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re lazy!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Blissfully, Eris.... Eris!... Eris, immortal goddess
of eternal discord.... Who gave you that lovely,
ominous name?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>&#8220;The ironical physician who brought me into the world,
I believe.... I believe I was well named.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t create discord.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I seem to; from birth,&#8221; she said absently. She bent over
a mass of rose-scented white peonies, inhaling the slightly
aromatic perfume.</p>

<p>Watching her, he said: &#8220;It&#8217;s hard for me to realise that
you&#8217;ve ever had troubles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hard for me, too,&#8221; she brushed her lips against the
delicate, crisp petals. &#8220;Troubles,&#8221; she said, &#8220;become unreal
when one&#8217;s mind remains interested.... I can&#8217;t even remember
how it feels to be unhappy.... A busy mind
forgets unessentials like trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>He said: &#8220;You&#8217;re rather amazing at times, do you know
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>He smiled: &#8220;Also,&#8221; he said, &#8220;there&#8217;s an incongruity about
this honeymoon of ours, Eris.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where, Mr. Annan?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Between your lips and mine&mdash;when you say &#8216;Mr. Annan&#8217;
and I answer, &#8216;Eris.&#8217; And on our honeymoon, too,&#8221; he
added gravely.</p>

<p>Her laughter was a little confused.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems natural for me to call you Mr. Annan. One is
not likely to think familiarly of famous people&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it a horrible sort of bourgeois respect for the mystery
of my art, Eris?&#8221;</p>

<p>She abandoned herself to laughter as his features grew
gloomier.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are funny,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but one&#8217;s first impressions
of people are not easily altered.... Would you wish me to
call you&mdash;Barry?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If consistent with your commendable and proper awe of
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment or two she was unable to control her
laughter. Then a moment&#8217;s hesitation, bright-eyed, flushed:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>&#8220;Barry,&#8221; she said, like a child plucking courage from
embarrassment.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>She had some books to show him from a list she had
asked him to make after one of their conferences on self-improvement.</p>

<p>They went over them together, she ardently intent on the
unread pages, he conscious of her nearness; the faint, warm
perfume of her bent head.</p>

<p>Her mantel-clock struck and she looked up incredulously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you&#8217;ve got to go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It <i>can&#8217;t</i> be noon, can it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll drive you to the studio.&#8221;</p>

<p>She called: &#8220;Hattie! Have you put up my lunch?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All ready, Miss Eris, honey!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a silence, Eris gazing absently at the outrageous
mantel-clock, Annan&#8217;s eyes on her face.</p>

<p>She drew a long, even breath: &#8220;Time&mdash;and its hours&mdash;like
a flight of bullets.... When can you come again?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Any day&mdash;any hour you can give me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.... You <i>will</i> begin work again, won&#8217;t you?&#8221; She
turned toward him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t, yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m so preoccupied with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;that isn&#8217;t possible!&#8221; She seemed so frankly perplexed
and disturbed that he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;No, that isn&#8217;t the reason.... I don&#8217;t know what
it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you tired, perhaps?&#8221; she asked with a winning concern
in her voice, that now always seemed to stir within him
those vague depths hitherto unsuspected.</p>

<p>Her mantel-clock tinkled the quarter-hour.</p>

<p>They both looked up at it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you must go to <i>your</i> work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s annoying, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>&#8220;It&#8217;s the way I feel about <i>my</i> work, too,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;d
rather be with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment she did not notice the analogy. Then she
turned and her face flushed in comprehension.</p>

<p>Neither spoke for a moment. Then she rose, went to
her bed-room, pulled on her hat, and came slowly out, not
looking at him.</p>

<p>As she moved toward the door his hand, lightly, then his
arm detained her, drew her to him face to face, held her in
slightest contact.</p>

<p>There was a damp sweetness to her mouth as he kissed it.
She did not change colour,&mdash;there was no emotion. Smooth,
cool, her face touched his&mdash;softly cool her relaxed hand
that he took into his.</p>

<p>He looked into grey eyes that looked back. He kissed a
fresh mouth that yielded like a flower but did not quiver.</p>

<p>Released, she stood apart, slender, still, not aloof, nor
altered visibly by the moment&#8217;s intimacy.</p>

<p>The little clock struck the half hour.</p>

<p>He came to her, drew her head back against his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to go,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Will you let me drive you
up to the studio? We&#8217;ll have time.&#8221;</p>

<p>She nodded; they went slowly to the door, down to the
hot street in silence.</p>

<p>On Greenwich Avenue, near the new theatre, still in
process of building, they found a taxi.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When they descended at the studio she was just on time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you so much,&#8221; she said, not offering him her hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;To-morrow, Eris?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t. I&#8217;m called for ten o&#8217;clock.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the evening, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m dining with Mr. Smull.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Could you lunch with me the day after that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</p>

<p>A pause: &#8220;Are you offended?&#8221; he asked in a low voice.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>She looked up, slightly shook her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t seem very anxious to see me again,&#8221; he added,
forcing a smile.</p>

<p>In the eyes of the girl he read neither response nor any
comment.</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t detain you now,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry you seem
to be unable to see me soon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you will feel like working soon,&#8221; she said quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll begin in a day or so.... Are you free day after
to-morrow, at any time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Could you come to dinner?&#8221;</p>

<p>His features altered swiftly: &#8220;You charming, generous
girl! Of course I&#8217;ll come&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye,&#8221; she nodded, and turned away into the portal
where the door-keeper on duty stood watching them.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">EXCEPT for one disquieting symptom, Annan had no
reason to suppose that his budding affair with Eris
was to develop and terminate differently from other agreeable
interludes in his airy career.</p>

<p>That symptom was a new one&mdash;an odd disinclination to
work because his mind was preoccupied with a girl.</p>

<p>No other tender episodes in this young man&#8217;s career had
interfered with his creative ability. On the contrary, they
had stimulated it.</p>

<p>Always he had taken such incidents gaily; always he remained
receptive, not seeking; the onus of initiative equally
shared; the normal end a mutual enlightenment, not too
tragic, and with the germ of future laughter always latent,
even quickening under tears.</p>

<p>There never had been any passion in these affairs&mdash;not
on his part anyway&mdash;unless a passion for the analysis of
reactions counted, and a passionate desire to comprehend
beauty, physical and intellectual; its multiple motives, responsibilities,
and penalties.</p>

<p>Partly experimental, partly sympathetically responsive,
always tenderly curious, this young man drifted gratefully
through the inevitable episodes to which all young men are
heir.</p>

<p>And something in him always transmuted into ultimate
friendship the sentimental chaos, where comedy and tragedy
clashed at the crisis.</p>

<p>The result was professional knowledge. Which, however,
he had employed rather ruthlessly in his work. For<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
he resolutely cut out all that had been agreeable to the
generations which had thriven on the various phases of
virtue and its rewards. Beauty he replaced with ugliness;
dreary squalor was the setting for crippled body and deformed
mind. The heavy twilight of Scandinavian insanity
touched his pages where sombre shapes born out of Jewish
Russia moved like anachronisms through the unpolluted
sunshine of the New World.</p>

<p>His were essays on the enormous meanness of mankind&mdash;mean
conditions, mean minds, mean aspirations, and a little
mean horizon to encompass all.</p>

<p>Out of his theme, patiently, deftly, ingeniously he extracted
every atom of that beauty, sanity, inspired imagination
which <i>makes</i> the imperfect more perfect, creates <i>better</i>
than the materials permit, <i>forces</i> real life actually to assume
and <i>be</i> what the passionate desire for sanity and beauty
demands.</p>

<p>For we become, visibly, what the passionate purpose of
the strongest among us demands. Bodies and minds alter
in the irresistible demand for beauty and sanity.</p>

<p>It is the fixed, inexorable aspiration of the strong that
has moved mankind out of its own natal ugliness&mdash;so far
upon the long, long journey toward sanity, beauty, and the
stars.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The old, old story: beauty is obvious and becomes trite:
the corruption from whence it sprung is the only interest.
Not the flower but the maggots in the manure which
nourishes it; not symmetry, but the causes that deform it;
not sanity but the microbes which undermine it.</p>

<p>Shadows everywhere framing a black abyss where, deep
in obscurity, cause and effect writhe endlessly like two great
worms....</p>

<p>And he became uneasy and uncomfortable and perplexed
because he seemed to be disinclined to continue work.</p>

<p>Eris was interfering. The damp sweetness of her mouth,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
her cool fresh body, the still clarity of gray eyes, hands
that lay in his lightly as dawn-chilled flowers....</p>

<p>Neither intention of mind and pen&mdash;nor even effort
where, hitherto, inspiration and mechanics had so suavely
co-ordinated&mdash;seemed to replace him and reassure him in
that easy security from whence, hitherto, he had inspected
mankind.</p>

<p>An indefinable subconsciousness was becoming a restlessness
shared by mind and body. And it finally set him adrift
from club to avenue&mdash;trivial resources of those who depend
upon externals for occupation.</p>

<p>Never before had Annan been at loss to know how to
entertain his mind. He had been an amusing host to
himself. Now, for the first time he was aware of a sort
of obscure impatience with the entertainment. Not that
his was becoming the sordid state of mind of the time-killer&mdash;most
contemptible of unconscious suicides and
slowest of any to enter that meaningless void for which
such human phantoms are fitted.</p>

<p>But it seemed that something was lacking to make self-entertainment
worth while. Exactly what this was he did
not know. There was effort now where none ever had
been. And that effort was the initiative of a mind seeking,
for the first time, its complement, vaguely, blindly irritated
by its own incompleteness.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>He went to see his aunt, but she wasn&#8217;t very glad to see
him.</p>

<p>The reason he called on her was to talk about Eris, but
Mrs. Grandcourt bluntly inquired what his interest might
be in an actress, and suggested that he mind his business
and try to foregather with women of his own caste.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t she?&#8221; he asked rather rashly.</p>

<p>But she, old, wise, disillusioned, and with a sort of weary
comprehension of men, made it plain that the granddaughter
of Jeanne d&#8217;Espremont concerned herself alone.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>As he was taking his leave:</p>

<p>&#8220;I can imagine,&#8221; she remarked, &#8220;nothing as contemptible
as any philandering with this child by any man of my
race.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went out with that in his ear.</p>

<p>It bored him all day. Finally it interested him. Because
that is exactly what would have happened in one of his
own stories&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Abruptly he was conscious that it <i>was</i> happening. That
this had to do with his restlessness. That possibly it was
desire to see this girl which was disturbing him.</p>

<p>He realised, now, that he wanted to see Eris; was impatient
at delay. Well, that was interesting anyway.
And, now that the possible cause of discomfort seemed
clearer, he decided to examine and analyse it coolly, professionally....</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Toward one o&#8217;clock in the morning, dead tired, he gave
it up. The cause of restlessness still abided with him. He
fell asleep, weary of visualisation&mdash;young eyes, crystal-grey,
that told him nothing, answered nothing&mdash;eyes virginal,
unaware, immaculate, incorruptible.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">WHEN Annan arrived at the Jane Street apartment,
Eris had just telephoned Hattie, the negro maid, that
she had been detained at the studio; would be late; and to
say this to Mr. Annan.</p>

<p>So constantly yet unconsciously during the two days&#8217;
separation had he visualised this meeting, pictured it to the
least detail, that this slight delay in realisation tightened a
nervous tension of which he had been aware all day.</p>

<p>It was rather ridiculous; he had seen her only two days
before. It had seemed much longer. Also, knowledge of
her dinner engagement with Albert Smull had not quieted
his impatience. But there had been nothing to do about it
except to send her fresh roses and a great sheaf of lilies.
Over the telephone he told Hattie to place these in her bed-room
before she returned.</p>

<p>So now he picked up the evening paper in the little living-room
and composed himself to wait.</p>

<p>The culinary clatter of Hattie in the kitchen came to him
fitfully; shrill voices from ragged children at play in the
sunset-flooded street; the grinding roar of motor trucks
herded like leviathans toward their west-side corrals; the
eternal jar and quiver of the vast, iron city. Otherwise,
silence; a heated stillness in the isolated abode of Eris,
&#8220;Daughter of Discord&#8221;; the subdued breath of his roses in
the air, which glimmered with gilded sun-dust; red rays
from the west painted across the eastern wall. And, possessing
all, a hushed magic&mdash;a spell invisible&mdash;the intimacy
of this absent girl;&mdash;its mystery, everywhere&mdash;in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
shadowy doorway beyond, from which stole the scent of
unseen lilies....</p>

<p>So intimate, so part of her seemed everything that even
his roses appeared intruders here in the rosy demi-dusk
where sun-rays barred door and window of her sanctuary
with barriers of crimson fire.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The evening paper had slipped to the floor. His speculative
eyes, remote, were fixed on the red rods of waning
light: he sat upright, unstirring, in the attitude of one who
hears without listening, but awaits the unheard.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>She came up the stairs, running lightly; flung open the
door ajar, greeted him with a little gasp of happy, breathless
recognition.</p>

<p>When she could explain at her ease: &#8220;Frank Donnell is
patching in and re-taking with me before Mr. Creevy
begins. To-morrow we finish, and the day after&mdash;&#8221;
she laughed excitedly, &#8220;&mdash;I begin with my own company!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wonderful!&#8221; he admitted; &#8220;I hope you&#8217;ll be as happy
and as fortunate with your new director, Eris.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope so. I&#8217;m very fond of Mr. Donnell&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; She
pulled off her blue turban, glanced over her shoulder into
the mirror, turned and looked happily at Annan. Then
her smile faded. &#8220;Aren&#8217;t you well?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly I am. Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought&mdash;you seemed thin&mdash;a trifle tired&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bored,&#8221; he nodded briefly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; she demanded, astonished.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. Probably because I&#8217;ve missed you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Recognising only a jest in kindness meant, she smiled
response and went into her bed-room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;my room is full of lilies!&#8221; She
came to the door, inarticulate with gratitude, exaggerating,
as always, kindness of giver and beauty of gift; then inadequately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
thanked him&mdash;invited him to enter and see
where Hattie had placed his flowers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t sleep with them; they&#8217;ll give you a headache,&#8221; he
remarked.</p>

<p>For a little while she lingered over the scented flowers.
Then there was just a moment&#8217;s hesitation; and, as he did
not seem inclined to leave, she seated herself at her dressing
table, shook out her bobbed hair&mdash;fleeting revelation of
close-set ears and nape milk-white under thickest chestnut
curls.</p>

<p>Deftly she re-parted, re-touched, coaxed, petted, intent
upon her business with this soft, crisp shock of curls. Her
every movement fascinated him&mdash;the twisted grace of her
lithe back, celerity of slender wrist and fingers,&mdash;white!&mdash;oh,
so white and swift and sure!...</p>

<p>He bent and touched her head with his lips. Movement
ceased instantly; hovering hands froze stiff, suspended;
she sat as motionless as the lilies in her room.</p>

<p>After a moment&#8217;s wordless silence, manual activity ventured
to resume, tentatively, with little intervals of hesitation&mdash;silent,
intent, inquiring perhaps; perhaps inherent
apprehension which turns the feminine five senses into ears.</p>

<p>&#8220;You want the place to yourself,&#8221; he said, as coolly as
he could; and sauntered into the living-room. Where he
resumed the evening paper as though impatient to read it.
But his eyes watched her closing door; rested there.</p>

<p>Before she reappeared, Hattie waddled into view to announce
dinner. Annan, pacing the room, impatient of his
own restlessness, turned nervously as Eris opened her door.
She wore a thin black gown&mdash;nothing to relieve its slim and
sombre simplicity except the snowy skin and the cheek&#8217;s
rose-warmth shadowed by gold-red hair.</p>

<p>She smiled her confidence; invited him with extended
hand. He took possession of her cool, bare arm, walked
slowly with her to the dining-room, seated her, touched her
hair lightly with his cheek.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>For all his fluency he found no word to link the liaison&mdash;nothing
to smooth the slight contact of caress.</p>

<p>She drew his attention to the rose beside his service plate:
he leaned toward her; she picked up the bud and drew it
through his lapel without embarrassment.</p>

<p>In the girl&#8217;s slight smile suddenly Annan found his
tongue. And now, as always, his easy flow of speech
began to stimulate her to an increasing facility of response.</p>

<p>Hers, too, was now the initiative as often as his; she told
him gaily about the closing hours at the studio under Frank
Donnell&#8217;s directorship; all about the assembling of her own
company under Mr. Creevy; about her new camera-man,
Emil Shunk; the search for stories; the several continuities
still under consideration. She spoke warmly of Albert
Smull, and of his partner, Leopold Shill; of their constant
generosity to her, and of her determination that they should
never regret their belief in her ability to make their investment
profitable.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems to me,&#8221; she said, &#8220;so amazing, so wonderful,
that such keen business men should venture to risk so much
on a girl they scarcely know, that it frightens me at
moments.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry,&#8221; he remarked with a shrug; &#8220;it&#8217;s a more
interesting gamble for them than the stock-market offers
these days. They&#8217;re having their fun out of it&mdash;Shill,
Smull &amp; Co.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! Do you think it&#8217;s quite that?&#8221; she asked,
flushing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;every enterprise is a risk of sorts,
isn&#8217;t it? To take a chance is always amusing. Nothing
flatters like picking a winner on one&#8217;s own best judgment.
You&#8217;re what Broadway calls &#8216;sure fire.&#8217; It doesn&#8217;t take
much courage to lay odds on you, Eris.&#8221;</p>

<p>She nodded, her colour still high: &#8220;Yes, I suppose Mr.
Smull looks at it that way. It really is a matter of business,
of course.... But he is very kind to me.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>&#8220;If it were anything except a matter of business it would
scarcely do, would it?&#8221; asked Annan carelessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I understand. Please tell me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean&mdash;it&#8217;s quite all right for a man to bet on a girl
if he believes her professionally capable. That&#8217;s finance&mdash;of
one sort. That&#8217;s a business investment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What other sort of investment is there?&#8221; she asked.
&#8220;Will you tell me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The other sort is to finance an enterprise out of&mdash;friendship.
That&#8217;s not legitimate&mdash;on either side....
And even when it&#8217;s sheer business it&#8217;s a ticklish one.&#8221;</p>

<p>She remained absorbed for a while in her own reflections.
Then, idling over her strawberries and orange ice: &#8220;Do
you think that a girl really has no right to accept such heavy
responsibility as is now mine?&#8221; she inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m thinking about your obligations&mdash;burdensome in
success, crushing in failure.... Because you are the kind
of girl who will so consider them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What kind of girl do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Conscientious.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But too sensitive, too generous, too easily overwhelmed
by a sense of obligations&mdash;mostly imaginary.&#8221;</p>

<p>She continued with her reflections and her strawberries.
Finally coffee was served; he lighted a cigarette. Eris had
not yet commented upon his final proposition.</p>

<p>&#8220;It really depends on the man,&#8221; he remarked, &#8220;how difficult
or how easy a girl&#8217;s position is to be. It&#8217;s always certain
to be difficult if the deal be merely a speculation in
friendship and not in business.&#8221;</p>

<p>She tasted her coffee: &#8220;Yes, it might be&mdash;perplexing,&#8221;
she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see the possibility of confusion?&mdash;gratitude worrying
about what is expected of it; dread of reproach for
benefits forgot&mdash;the mask to choose and wear in the lively
hope of benefits to come&mdash;no; speculation in friendship is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
never legitimate gambling. It&#8217;s bad business, bad sportsmanship.&#8221;</p>

<p>She considered this over her coffee, her serious eyes
intent on the flecks of foam in her cup, with which she
played with her little silver spoon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think,&#8221; she said slowly, &#8220;that Mr. Smull is
taking a legitimate chance in financing my company?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a perfectly legitimate risk. I told you so.
You&#8217;re sure fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked up: &#8220;Do you think that was Mr. Smull&#8217;s
motive?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, Eris.&#8221;</p>

<p>After a pause: &#8220;You don&#8217;t like him, do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you tell me why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not quite sure why.... Do you like him, Eris?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d be ashamed not to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because he&#8217;s kind?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why you say you like me,&#8221; observed Annan,
smiling.</p>

<p>She smiled, too, rather vaguely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that the reason you like me, Eris?&#8221; he persisted&mdash;&#8220;because
you consider me kind?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think it is?&#8221; she murmured, still smiling
a little to herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not certain you like me as well as you once did.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy obvious, suddenly! The eternal and beloved ass
that every woman is destined to meet. And forgive.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;think I do,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Like me as well as you once did?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! My conversation still amuses you. But otherwise&mdash;well,
I&#8217;m afraid you don&#8217;t care quite as much for
me as you did, Eris.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;&mdash;with slow lifted eyes.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>&#8220;Because I kissed you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The ass obvious, at last!</p>

<p>She made no reply. Perhaps he hoped for shy denial&mdash;for
some diffident evasion anyway. Her unembarrassed
silence troubled him because he had not really harboured
the fear he pretended.</p>

<p>Now, however, the possibility made him uneasy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Glance into your mirror, Eris,&#8221; he said lightly, &#8220;and
tell me how I could have helped what I did.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her face, partly averted, remained so, unflushed, unresponsive.</p>

<p>Hattie opened the kitchen door and looked in, bulking like
a vast, dark cloud.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may come in and clear up,&#8221; said Eris quietly.
She rose from the table and they walked into the farther
room and seated themselves, she on the sofa, with an untroubled
aloofness that did not encourage him to closer
approach than a chair pulled up opposite her.</p>

<p>She had turned to some of his flowers as though to
include them in a friendly circle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your roses are such heavenly company,&#8221; she said in a
low voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never knew anybody so charmingly interested in
flowers,&#8221; he said with smiling malice.</p>

<p>She understood, laughed, turned to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m interested, also, to hear how your novel is progressing,&#8221;
she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you worked?&#8221; she inquired with sweet concern.</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; he said deliberately, &#8220;my mind is too full of
you to contain anything else.&#8221;</p>

<p>A pause: &#8220;Then,&#8221; she said, &#8220;you had better not see me
until you feel inclined to resume work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t seem to care very much,&#8221; he remarked.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>She was looking again at the roses. She made no reply.
The cold, rosy loveliness of her enthralled and chilled him.
Where the chestnut hair touched her cheek a carnation flush
warmed the slight shadow.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll resume work,&#8221; he said abruptly.</p>

<p>She nodded, her face close to the roses.</p>

<p>&#8220;How would you like me to make a scenario of my last
novel for you?&#8221; he asked. He had prepared this surprise
during the two days&#8217; separation&mdash;had even visualised her
delight.</p>

<p>If he expected emotional response, the impulsive gratitude
that hitherto had so charmingly over-valued his little
gifts, he was to be stunningly disappointed.</p>

<p>She turned and looked at him out of frankly troubled
eyes; and from that moment he learned that whatever he
ever was to have from this girl would be only what her
honesty could offer.</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t play such a part,&#8221; she said.... &#8220;You are
most kind.... But I never could be able to do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why? Do you think it would prove too difficult?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, ... too difficult ... because I don&#8217;t believe in
such a part&mdash;or in such a character.&#8221;</p>

<p>He sat thunderstruck. Then he flushed to the temples
and the last rag of masculine condescension fell from him,
leaving him boyishly bewildered and chagrined.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean that you don&#8217;t <i>like</i> the story?&#8221; he asked
incredulously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I like the way you wrote it. But my opinion is of no
value. Everybody says it is a great novel. Betsy told
me that the whole country is madly discussing it. Everybody
who can judge such things knows that it is a very
wonderful book. So does it matter what I think&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It does, to <i>me</i>,&#8221; he said almost savagely. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t
you like it, Eris?&#8221;</p>

<p>She was silent, and his tone changed: &#8220;Won&#8217;t you tell
me why?&#8221; he pleaded.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>Again the order reversed&mdash;the eternal cry of Eris on <i>his</i>
lips, now,&mdash;he, her court of appeal, appealing to her,&mdash;in
mortified quest of knowledge,&mdash;of truth, perhaps,&mdash;or,
astonished, wounded in snobbery and pride, seeking some
remedy for the surprising hurt&mdash;some shred of his former
authority to guide her back into the attitude which now
he realised had meant so much to unconscious snobbery and
happy vanity.</p>

<p>And now Eris knew that their hour for understanding
had arrived. She had much to say to him. Her clasped
hands tightened nervously in her lap but the level eyes
were steady.</p>

<p>She said, very slowly: &#8220;I have known unhappiness,
Mr. Annan. And ugliness. And hardship. But I&#8217;d be
ashamed to let my mind dwell upon these things....
Stories where life begins without hope and continues hopelessly,
seem needless and more or less distorted. And
rather cowardly.... One&#8217;s mind dwells most constantly
on what one likes.... I do not like deformity. Also, it
is not the rule; it is the exception.... So is ugliness.
And evil. A little seasons art sufficiently.... Only beasts
eat garlic wholesale.... Those who find perpetual interest
in misshapen minds and bodies and souls are either physicians
or are themselves in some manner misshapen....
Unhappiness, ugliness, squalor, misery, evil,&mdash;in the midst
of these, or of the even more terrible isolation of the lonely
mind,&mdash;always one can summon courage to dream nobly....
And what one dares dream one can become,&mdash;inwardly
always,&mdash;often outwardly and actually.&#8221;</p>

<p>She lifted her deep, grey eyes to his reddened face.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do admire you, and your mind, and your skill in
attainment. But I have not been able to comprehend the
greatness of what you write, and what all acclaim....
I do not like it. I cannot.</p>

<p>&#8220;I could neither understand nor play such a character
as the woman in your last book.... Nor could I ever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
believe in her.... Nor in the ugliness of her world&mdash;the
world you write about, nor in the dreary, hopeless, malformed,
starving minds you analyse.... My God, Mr.
Annan&mdash;are there no wholesome brains in the world you
write about?... I&#8217;m sorry.... You know that I am
ignorant, not experienced, crude&mdash;trying to learn truths,
striving to see and understand.... I have not travelled
far on any road. But I shall never live long enough to
travel the road you follow, nor shall I ever comprehend
such vision, such intention, such art as you have mastered....
You are a master. I do believe that.... Always you
have remained very wonderful to me.... Your mind....
Your wisdom.... <i>You.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>She clasped her slender fingers tighter over her knees
but looked at him out of clear, intelligent eyes that seemed
almost black in their purplish depths.</p>

<p>&#8220;With me,&#8221; she said, &#8220;the love of beauty, and the belief
in it, give me all my strength. I need to believe in beauty:
it is my first necessity.... And remains my last....
And I never have discovered a truth that is not beautiful....
There is no ugliness, no evil in Truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>He got to his feet slowly, and began to walk about the
room in an aimless, nervous way, as though under some
vague, indefinite menace,&mdash;of proven inferiority, perhaps.</p>

<p>Reaction set in toward boyish self-assertion; and it came
with a sudden rush,&mdash;and a forced laugh that, unexpectedly
to her, exposed his wound.</p>

<p>Surprised that he had suffered such a one, incredulous
that so slight a mind as hers had dealt it, she sat watching
him. Gradually all the bright hardness in her gaze melted
to a tender grey. Yet, it seemed incredible that so slight
a creature as she could matter to him intellectually,&mdash;could
have hurt so brilliantly armoured a being.</p>

<p>And then, all suddenly, she realised she had hurt a boy
and not a mind.</p>

<p>He came to her where she was seated, took her hands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
from her lap, looked wretchedly into her eyes, starry now
with imminence of tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;All that really matters,&#8221; he said, &#8220;is that your mind
should forgive mine and your heart care for mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>His clasp was drawing her to her feet; and she stood up,
not resisting, not confused, nor betraying any emotion
visible to him, unless he understood the starry brilliancy of
her young eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m falling in love with you, Eris. That is the only
thing that matters,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>He kissed her mouth twice; drew her warm head to his
breast; touched her face with his lips, very gently,&mdash;her
clustered curls; and she looked back at him out of eyes in
which light trembled.</p>

<p>If her soft, cool lips remained unresponsive, at least they
did not avoid his, nor did her cool body drawn close, closely
imprisoned.</p>

<p>After a long while, against him, he was aware of her
heart, hurrying. In the first flash of boyish passion he
crushed her in his arms and felt her breath and lips suddenly
hot against his.</p>

<p>Then, in the instant, she had disengaged herself violently
and had stepped clear of him, scarlet and silent. Nor spoke
until he followed and she had avoided him again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t&mdash;do that,&#8221; she said unsteadily.... &#8220;You&mdash;hurt
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eris! I love you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t say that.... I don&#8217;t like it.... I don&#8217;t <i>like</i>
it,&#8221; she repeated breathlessly.</p>

<p>A silence&mdash;confusion of hurrying atoms of time&mdash;a faint
flash from chaos.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you care for me, Eris?&#8221; he whispered.</p>

<p>She turned on him, pale, controlled: &#8220;I don&#8217;t like what
you did, I tell you!... And that&#8217;s <i>that</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>For a long while they stood there, unstirring.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you dismiss me?&#8221; he asked at last.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>She made no reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Had you rather that I should go, Eris?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; he asked, like a whipped boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I am tired of you,&#8221; she said evenly.</p>

<p>He stepped to the corridor, took his hat and stick, but
lingered, all hot with the rebuff, despising himself for
lingering. He laid his hand on the door-knob, miserably
hoping, miserable in his self-contempt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eris!&#8221;</p>

<p>She did not even turn her head.</p>

<p>He left the hall door open, still miserably hoping, scorning
himself, but lagging on the stairs. As he reached the street
door he heard her close her own with a crash and bolt it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was after midnight,&mdash;and after she had finished crying,&mdash;that
the girl began to undress.</p>

<p>Once she thought she heard him return,&mdash;thought she
heard his voice at her door, calling her; and her eyes flamed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But on her pillow she began to cry again, soundlessly,
one arm flung across her face.</p>

<p>Eris, daughter of Discord....</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">COLTFOOT had a short note from Annan asking him
to lunch. He called up, saying that he couldn&#8217;t get
away until afternoon.</p>

<p>When he did arrive at No. 3 Governor&#8217;s Place, Mrs.
Sniffen said that Mr. Annan was lying down&mdash;that for the
last two weeks he had not seemed to be very well.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong with him?&#8221; asked Coltfoot.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, sir. &#8217;E doesn&#8217;t go out any more. &#8217;E
&#8217;asn&#8217;t left the &#8217;ouse in the last fortnight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s nothing. He&#8217;s working.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir; Mr. Annan don&#8217;t write. He just reads or sits
quiet like till a fit takes &#8217;im sudden, and then he walks and
walks and walks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does he eat?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing to keep a canary &#8217;ealthy. It&#8217;s &#8217;igh-balls what
keep &#8217;im up, Mr. Coltfoot; and I &#8217;ate to say so, but it
worrits me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Annan doesn&#8217;t drink,&#8221; said Coltfoot incredulously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, sir&mdash;a glass of claret at dinner&mdash;a cocktail perhaps.
It&#8217;s only the last two weeks that I &#8217;ave to keep &#8217;im
in ice and siphons.&#8221;</p>

<p>Coltfoot, puzzled, thought a moment: &#8220;All right,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll go up.&#8221;</p>

<p>Annan, lying on the lounge, heard him and sat up.</p>

<p>They shook hands; Annan pushed the Irish whiskey toward
him and pointed to the ice and mineral water.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mike,&#8221; he said, &#8220;is my stuff rotten?&#8221;</p>

<p>Coltfoot, who had been inspecting his thin features,
laughed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>&#8220;Not so rotten,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You once said it was all wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Probably professional jealousy, Barry&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He constructed
an iced draught for himself, sipped it, furtively
noticing the bluish shadows on Annan&#8217;s temples and under
his cheek-bones.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with you?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing.... I&#8217;m worried because I can&#8217;t write.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rot, my son.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s quite true. I haven&#8217;t touched a pen for a month,
nearly.... The hell of it is that I&#8217;ve nothing to say.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good God, Mike,&#8221; he burst out, &#8220;do you think I&#8217;m
done for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think not,&#8221; drawled the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because&mdash;I can&#8217;t work. I <i>can&#8217;t</i>. I seem to be in a
sort of nightmare state of mind.... Did you ever feel
that the world&#8217;s askew and everything out of proportion?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I never did. Something has happened to you,
Barry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing&mdash;important.... No.... But I&#8217;m rather
scared about my work. You know those stories I did for
you? I hate them!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You ungrateful young devil, they made you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>What</i> did they make me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A best-seller&mdash;for one item. A fine workman for
another&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mike! Who cares for good workmanship in these
days? Who understands it when he sees it? Who does
it?</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a jerry-age,&mdash;jerry-built houses, furniture, machinery,&mdash;jerry-built
literature, music, drama,&mdash;jerry-built
nations too,&mdash;and marriages and children and every damned
thing that once required good workmanship.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, everything is glue and pasteboard and unskilled
labour&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>&#8220;Oh, lay off on your jerry-built jeremiad!&#8221; cried Coltfoot,
laughing. &#8220;Where do you get that stuff?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stuff is right, too. I&#8217;m a fake, also. I&#8217;m a jerry-built
author with a jerry-built education and I write jerry-bui&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
He dodged a lump of ice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shut up,&#8221; said Coltfoot wearily. &#8220;How long do you
think I&#8217;m going to listen? Come on, now, what&#8217;s started
you skidding, Barry?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You started me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;that line of talk I handed you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It got under my skin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! Who&#8217;s been sticking the knife into you since?
Not your fool public. Not the Great American Ass.&#8221;</p>

<p>Annan shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, who?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Another&mdash;friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that what upset you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.... Partly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not ill, are you, Barry?&#8221; inquired the elder man,
curiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I should say not!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Financial troubles?... You don&#8217;t mind my asking?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it isn&#8217;t anything of that sort, Mike.... It really
isn&#8217;t anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not&mdash;in love.... Are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hang it all, no, I&#8217;m not!... No.... I&#8217;ve never been
in love, Mike.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve had a few affairs, dear friend,&#8221; remarked Coltfoot,
amused.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you know the kind. Everybody has &#8217;em. Everybody
has that sort. That&#8217;s just vanity&mdash;silliness&mdash;no harm,
you know.... The young are always sparring&mdash;like little
chicks and kittens.&#8221;</p>

<p>Coltfoot finished his glass. There was an interval;
Annan set both elbows on his knees and framed his drawn
face between his hands.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m not in love,&#8221; he said as though to himself.</p>

<p>They discussed other matters. But now and then Annan
drifted back to love, and his ignorance of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; he said carelessly, &#8220;a fellow is able to diagnose
the thing if he gets it.... Recognise it.... Don&#8217;t
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Probably.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose every fellow stands a chance of landing there
sooner or later.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You write about it. Don&#8217;t you know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly.... I&#8217;m familiar with some phases of it....
The phenomena are well known.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The various sorts of love and its aftermath that you
write about are enough to scare any man off that stuff,&#8221;
remarked Coltfoot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Those are the sorts I&#8217;ve seen.... Or the cut and dried
hypocrisy of my own kind and kindred.... I&#8217;ve seen
darned few cases of satisfactory and enduring love....
Darned few, Mike.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then there are a few?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not write about one such incident?&#8221;</p>

<p>After a silence Annan lifted his eyes and gave him a
haggard look.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid of Christmas-card stuff, I guess.... Mike,
I&#8217;ve always been afraid of it. I&#8217;ve had a morbid fear of
weakness.... And do you know I believe <i>that</i> was the
real weakness? I <i>am</i> weak!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Barry, you&#8217;ve merely had things come to you too easily.
You&#8217;ve had your own way too much. You&#8217;re persuasive;
you get it. You&#8217;ve been, perhaps, a little self-complacent,
a bit smug, a trifle cocksure.... All strength is in danger
of such phases. But weakness never is. Weakness <i>must</i>
assert itself or silently acquiesce in its own visible inferiority.
For the bragger is the weakling, not he who does
not need to assert himself.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>&#8220;And always there lies a danger in the reticence of
strength that, unawares, complacency and self-satisfaction
may taint it, and strength go stale.&#8221;</p>

<p>After a silence: &#8220;My stuff has been pretty narrow, I
guess,&#8221; muttered Annan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Narrow calibre, perhaps; but powerful. You can shoot
a bigger gun and bigger projectile, Barry. I don&#8217;t know
what your limits may be, but I know they&#8217;re wide&mdash;if you
care to range them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s nice of you, Mike.... I guess I&#8217;ll feel like
working ... pretty soon.... As for falling in love,
... I suppose I&#8217;ll know it if I do.... Don&#8217;t you think
so?&#8221;</p>

<p>Coltfoot took his hat and stick:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure. I don&#8217;t believe the thing conforms always
to specific gravity or Troy weight or carats or decimals.
I don&#8217;t believe that a standard test will always give the same
reaction.&#8221; He scowled: &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe there&#8217;s such a
thing as love in elemental supply. I think it&#8217;s always found
in combination&mdash;endless combinations.... And how the
hell you&#8217;re to recognise it, candidly, I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stay to dinner; will you, Mike?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sorry.... By the way, how is your little waif, the
Goddess of Discord, getting on with Smull?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, I fancy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you see her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t lately.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, the gossip is that she&#8217;s sure fire. Frank Donnell
believes in her. I&#8217;ve heard that Smull is crazy about her
and stands to back her to the limit.... I&#8217;m sorry&mdash;rather.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About what?&#8221; asked Annan sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, in Frank Donnell she had a gentleman. But
Creevy is a vulgar fellow. His staff isn&#8217;t so much, either.
Too bad the little girl couldn&#8217;t have remained in Betsy
Blythe&#8217;s company. It was a decent bunch.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t hers?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;I guess it&#8217;s endurable.... Creevy is a rat. So&#8217;s
Emil Shunk. Marc Blither and Harry Quiss are just common
and harmless.... Of course, if anybody offends your
little prot&eacute;g&eacute;e Albert Smull will do murder.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t like Smull,&#8221; said Annan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Neither do you.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When Coltfoot had gone Annan went to the telephone.
And sat there for an hour without calling anybody. He
had done this every day for two weeks. Sometimes he
did it several times a day.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sniffen knocked and asked him what he wished for
dinner.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; he said absently.</p>

<p>She stood waiting for a while: &#8220;Will you ring, sir, when
you decide?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I will, Xantippe.... Thank you.&#8221;</p>

<p>After she had been gone for some time: &#8220;Well,&#8221; he
breathed, &#8220;I&mdash;I can&#8217;t call her and keep any self-respect....
I simply can&#8217;t do it.... She&#8217;s through with me anyway....
I suppose I acted like a cad.... She wasn&#8217;t
the girl to understand such affairs.... She is better than
such things.... Or too stupid for them.... Stupid in
that way only.... Too damned serious.... My God,
what a hiding she gave me for my book!... But the other
was worse.... I haven&#8217;t any self-respect when I remember
that.... If I call her now, she can&#8217;t take any more
away from me, as she&#8217;s got all I had....&#8221;</p>

<p>He came back to the telephone. He could feel the painful
colour hot in his face as he unhooked the receiver.</p>

<p>In a hard voice he called her number.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; he said with an oath, &#8220;she can do her damnedest!&#8221;</p>

<p>She did.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">HATTIE&#8217;S voice answered him: &#8220;Who is it, please?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Annan. Is Miss Odell at home?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll enquiah, suh. Please to hold the wiah.&#8221;</p>

<p>He could hear her fat feet clattering away along the
corridor. An endless, endless wait, almost a quarter of a
minute. Steps again on the tiled corridor,&mdash;not Hattie&#8217;s;
then the composed voice of Eris:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Annan?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.... Do you&mdash;are you quite all right?&#8221; he faltered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite, thank you. Are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m fine.... I&#8217;m so glad you&#8217;re all right....
Do you mind my calling up?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hoped you would,&#8221; she replied calmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;D-did you?&mdash;really?&#8221; he stammered, unable to believe
his ears.</p>

<p>&#8220;Naturally. I&#8217;ve wondered whether you have been too
busy to call me. Have you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not exactly&mdash;busy. Do you&mdash;suppose I&mdash;I could see
you, Eris?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you suppose you couldn&#8217;t?&#8221; she asked in a low voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know.... When may I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Probably,&#8221; she said, &#8220;you have an engagement this
evening&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No! I&#8217;m not doing anything at all!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then&mdash;will you come?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. What time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Any</i> time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you&mdash;do you mean <i>now</i>?&#8221; he cried, enchanted.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>Her reply was slightly indistinct: &#8220;Yes, as soon as you
possibly can&mdash;if you would be&mdash;so kind&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Again the low hanging sun at the western end of Jane
Street, cherry-red in the river mist, washing out all shabbiness
and squalor in a rosy bath of light.</p>

<p>A barrel-organ, played by an old, old man, drew legions
of ragged children to the pavement in front of her house,
where they whirled like gnats at sunset, dancing to some
forgotten rag&mdash;the sun spinning its nimbus around each
dishevelled, childish head.</p>

<p>Annan made his way through the milling swarm with a
caress for those who stumbled across his path and a silver-piece
tossed to the ancient where he leaned on his organ,
bent almost double, tears perpetual in his sunken eyes.</p>

<p>He ran up the stairs; knocked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, Hattie,&#8221; he tried to say&mdash;scarcely conscious of
voice at all, or sight or hearing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go right in, Mr. Annan, suh&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He was already going, not knowing any longer what he
was about. The sun-glare on the windows dazzled him
a moment before he saw her.</p>

<p>She was standing at the further end of the room. He
went slowly toward her, not knowing how they were to
meet after ages of dead days.</p>

<p>Then, still knowing nothing, he took her into his arms.</p>

<p>Her mouth warmed slightly against his. As his embrace
tightened, her hands hovered close to his shoulders, touched
them, crept upward.</p>

<p>Suddenly the girl strained him to her with all her
strength.</p>

<p>In the silence of passionate possession, her lips melted
to his, ... a moment, ... then her head dropped on his
arm with a sob.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was lonely;&mdash;you made me feel lonely.... Where
have you been?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been in love with you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She released herself but clung to his hand. They came
together again, sank down on the lounge together.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been lonely,&#8221; she repeated; &#8220;&mdash;it&#8217;s been deathly
lonely without you.... I&#8217;m tired&mdash;of the pain of it....&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Dusk in the room turned golden with a rosy tinge. They
had not spoken. His gaze never left her face. At intervals
she rested her bobbed head against him, confused by
the dire ruin that once had been her mind before love burst
in, disordering everything.</p>

<p>Now, groping for the origin of the cataclysm, she retraced
her progress through a maze of memories to the
first step. The Park! Vision of hot stars overhead;
vision of the great bed where she lay in this man&#8217;s house;
vision of the Coast&mdash;a confusion of sunshine and feverish
endeavour;&mdash;but in none of these was the germ of The
Beginning.... Yet she was drawing nearer now. The
place of the birth of love was not far away.... Suddenly
she found it.</p>

<p>And, as this man now was to know everything that she
knew, Eris prepared to bare her untried heart.... She
offered her lips first; looked into his eyes with a vague and
virgin curiosity.</p>

<p>&#8220;&mdash;And after you went out,&#8221; she continued, &#8220;what had
happened seemed suddenly to demoralise me. I was exasperated....
I tore your rose from my belt and threw it
after you.... I slammed the door and bolted it....
As though I could bolt out what had happened to me!&mdash;&#8221;
She laughed and looked happily into his eyes,&mdash;&#8220;Barry!
As though I could bolt it out!&#8221;</p>

<p>He kissed her hands; her lips caressed his bent head.</p>

<p>&#8220;... And, do you know,&#8221; she went on, &#8220;I even swore
at you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Swore at&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Laughter checked him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I damned you. I knew how to. They swear hard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
on farms.... Oh, Barry, I swore at you like a hired
man!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You dear,&#8221; he said, &#8220;&mdash;you dear!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You say that now, but you nearly drove me mad that
evening.... You <i>did</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was half crazy myself, Eris&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Were you!&#8221; she pleaded with swift tenderness. &#8220;Oh,
Barry, you are <i>thin</i>! You look <i>ill</i>. I was frightened when
you came in this evening&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She drew his head to her again, caressed it, tender, penitent:</p>

<p>&#8220;You are <i>not</i> well. Can I do anything?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are doing it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know.... I wish I could take care of you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re going to feed me, presently.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You make a joke of it; but you&#8217;re <i>ill</i>, and I did it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Blessed child, I&#8217;ll be so fat in a week that I&#8217;ll waddle
like Hattie!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Show me,&#8221; she urged, enchanted.</p>

<p>He got up and tried to waddle, and she sank back, convulsed.</p>

<p>In fact, they both had become rather light headed by the
time Hattie announced dinner.</p>

<p>It was love&#8217;s April&mdash;gusty with unbidden gaiety&mdash;with
heavenly intervals of calm; of caprice; of stormy contact;
of smiles, tremulous, close to tears&mdash;lips touching in wonder;
and the sudden breeze of laughter freshening, refreshing
mind and body:&mdash;their April in Love after youth&#8217;s long
winter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor boy,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I&#8217;ve rather a horrid dinner for
you. I was dining out, and you didn&#8217;t give me time&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You broke a dinner engagement for me, Eris?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I telephoned Nancy Cassell that I couldn&#8217;t come. It
doesn&#8217;t matter.... Anyway, that&#8217;s why you&#8217;re having
omelette and minced chicken....&#8221;</p>

<p>Now and then she slipped her cool, smooth hand into his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
under the camouflage of the cloth. And she ate so, sometimes
awkwardly; and clung a little to his hand when he
would have released hers.</p>

<p>Once she drew a deep, uneven breath: &#8220;I never expected
to be in love,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Oh, Barry, it&#8217;s so inconvenient!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How?&#8221; he protested.</p>

<p>&#8220;My <i>dear</i>! I work like the dickens! It would be all
right if I could come back to you at night. But this
way&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>After a silence: &#8220;That must happen, too, Eris.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have to talk to you about that.... And there are
evenings when I must study&mdash;rehearse before the mirror&mdash;or
read very hard. And some evenings I am dead tired.... And
then there are dinners.... And one&#8217;s friends.... Darling!&mdash;you
look at me so oddly!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;as I&#8217;m in love with you, I&#8217;d rather like to see you
more than twice a year&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed and caught his hands&mdash;set her lips to them&mdash;looked
up at him again with her heart in her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;To be loved by <i>you</i>!&#8221; she said, &#8220;is too wonderful for
me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Once,&#8221; he reminded her with malice, &#8220;you told me you
were tired of me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Her shocked face checked him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was only joking, Eris&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I <i>did</i> say it! And I was already in love with you when
I said it. God and you punished me instantly. But I
couldn&#8217;t ever bear to have you two do it again&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Somebody had sent her some cordials,&mdash;mint, cura&ccedil;oa,&mdash;that
sort. She was unaccustomed&mdash;had no taste for such
things. But she was happy to show him her sideboard after
dinner.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all for you. You like such things, don&#8217;t you?
Well, then, I&#8217;m going to keep them for you.... Rosalind
goes schmoozing about when she comes here. Other girls,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
also. But I&#8217;ve been unutterably mean&mdash;and I&#8217;ve hoarded
it for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you <i>did</i> expect me to call you up?&#8221; he asked,
laughingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Lord, I didn&#8217;t know. If you hadn&#8217;t called me I
couldn&#8217;t have stood it much longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you have called me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course.... Or died.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you call me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was afraid.... And I wasn&#8217;t quite dead, yet&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of what were you afraid?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew you must be very bored with me.... And
there was something else.... It scared me.... It still
exists.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me, Eris.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; I&#8217;ll have to tell you, now.&#8221; They rose from the
table and she took his arm.... &#8220;But you <i>must</i> love me,
Barry!&mdash;I&#8217;ve got to be loved by you now.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the lamp-lit sitting room he drew her to him: &#8220;How
could I help loving you, Eris?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want you to help it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t, anyway. So you needn&#8217;t fear to tell me
anything you please.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.... I&#8217;ve got to tell you, whether it scares me or
not.... I think I&#8217;d rather wait until just before you
go.&#8221;</p>

<p>She curled up on the sofa close to him, one hand clasping
her ankles, the other against his shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Also, I want to explain to you,&#8221; she said, &#8220;that I didn&#8217;t
know Mrs. Grandcourt was your aunt until <i>after</i> I&#8217;d fallen
in love with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t follow the continuity&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean I&#8217;m not socially ambitious.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was still mystified.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know you were so very important socially,&#8221;
she explained.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;m not. My aunt thinks she is, but really she isn&#8217;t any
more. Life passed her on the road at eighty with every
cylinder hitting. I never travelled that highway. But my
poor aunt still trundles along it in an ancient victoria.
Even the flivvers cover her old-mine diamonds with plebeian
joy-dust&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Eris, helpless with laughter, clung to his shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t wish to laugh,&#8221; she protested. &#8220;Your aunt is
nice to me.... Though rather horrid to Betsy.... It
seems she knew my grandmother. She says she told you
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When did she admit to you that my relationship disgraced
her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yesterday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, so you continue to see her in town?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I lunched with her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In her private morgue?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It <i>is</i> gloomy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose, while she was about it, she handed you a
lurid line or two regarding me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;yes.... I am instructed to beware of you....
Darling!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you going to beware of me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>He kissed her threateningly: &#8220;What do you suppose my
aunt would think if she knew you had once been my guest
over night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I told her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Barry, I couldn&#8217;t allow her to be so friendly unless
she understood what sort of girl I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t tell her about the Park, also?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did she take it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She said such severe things about you&mdash;I was quite
annoyed!... Dreadful things, darling&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>&#8220;About <i>me</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. She called you several ghastly names&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;&#8216;libertine&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>He roared with laughter but Eris had turned rosy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I told her very plainly that you were <i>not</i>,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;I told her you were kind and generous and harmless&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good Lord!&#8221; he exclaimed, helpless with laughter again.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you laughing at? You <i>are</i> harmless!&#8221; she
repeated. &#8220;Aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, darling.... But some encomiums hurt as well
as edify.... Never mind. Go on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was all.... Except she tried to persuade me to
give up my profession. She always does.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What does she graciously suggest for you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I suppose she wishes to be kind to me because she
was very fond of my grandmother.... But I couldn&#8217;t go
and live with her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She asked you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Eris nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;My aunt,&#8221; he said good humouredly, &#8220;is very rich and
very stingy. You&#8217;re the only person I ever heard of on
whom she was ready to spend real money. What did she
propose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Adoption, I believe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord! She really must have cared for your grandmother....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think she really did.&#8221;</p>

<p>After a silence: &#8220;You declined?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Darling! Do you think such things count with me?&#8221;</p>

<p>After a silence: &#8220;Did you tell her I&#8217;d ever kissed you?&#8221;
he asked curiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>That</i> was none of her business, Barry.&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughed: &#8220;So you pass up the wealthy aunt for the
libertine nephew? Do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do. I like him. In fact, I&#8217;m rather in the way of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
loving him. Also, I love liberty, and freedom to pursue
happiness. Happiness means work, and you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which comes first, work or me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Darling!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Which?</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t have to make that choice&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose you had to?&#8221; he insisted.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d be fearfully unhappy&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;d choose work.... Would you, Eris?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;suppose so.... Probably I&#8217;d die in either case....
Work means life.... I guess you do, too. But
if I had to choose I&#8217;d choose work, I suppose.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nothing ever had touched him so deeply; nor had so profoundly
surprised him.</p>

<p>He said: &#8220;Every word I ever have heard you utter
merely reveals new beauty in you,&mdash;and my own heart,
more and more in love with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He drew her close to his breast; spoke with his lips on
her cheek:</p>

<p>&#8220;Would marrying me hamper you?... Had you rather
wait until you are more secure in your profession?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Darling!&#8221; she said pitifully, &#8220;&mdash;that is what I had to
tell you. I <i>am</i> married.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stared at her astounded.</p>

<p>After a tense silence: &#8220;Please love me&mdash;Barry&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; she
whispered. &#8220;Please, dear!&#8221;</p>

<p>She clasped her hands in appeal, as unconscious of drama
as she had been that day on Whitewater Brook when Mr.
Quiss threatened to swim out of her ken.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&#8220;Barry! Are you disgusted?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, it seems so impossible&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To love me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&mdash;that you&mdash;<i>you</i> ever have been married!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t been&mdash;entirely.... Only legally ... and
partly.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>He thought: &#8220;My God, there seems to be something the
matter with everybody and everything.&#8221; And to Eris:
&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you ever tell me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was none of your business until I fell in love with
you, was it?&#8221;</p>

<p>He caught her in his arms, roughly: &#8220;It&#8217;s my business
now. Do you understand? I&#8217;ll never give you up....
Look at me, Eris!&#8221;</p>

<p>He was hurting her; and she smiled and endured her
bruises, breast and lips and limb.</p>

<p>She said: &#8220;If you marry me I shall have to get unmarried
first&mdash;somehow or other&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is&mdash;this man?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, darling.... This was how it all occurred&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Now, sullenly, and in silence he listened to the sordid
story of the marriage of Eris.</p>

<p>She told it without resentment&mdash;and with the candour
and brevity of a child.</p>

<p>Always it had seemed to her as though she had been
merely a witness of the miserable affair and not personally
concerned. And she told it in that manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, it really doesn&#8217;t count,&#8221; she concluded. &#8220;I was
so ignorant that it meant nothing to me at the time. I
scarcely ever think of it, now. Barry.... I <i>want</i> you to
love me.... But if you had rather not marry me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He reddened: &#8220;What alternative do you suggest?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;this!&mdash;as we are.... It leaves us both free to
work&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>That</i> is your ruling passion,&#8221; he said bluntly, &#8220;&mdash;work!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If we don&#8217;t marry, I can have you, and work, too&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think me narrow enough, selfish enough, to interfere
with your career if you marry me?&#8221;</p>

<p>She answered gravely: &#8220;I wasn&#8217;t afraid of that.... I
was afraid of&mdash;children&mdash;if I marry you ... dearest.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>&#8220;But if&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Then the candour of her chaste self-revelation
grew clear to him&mdash;her exquisite ignorance, her virgin
confidence in the heavenly inviolability of love.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you understand, Barry?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; she explained, &#8220;unmarried I can go and still
have you.... But careers often end when children come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you ever want them, Eris?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;as I&#8217;ve never had any, isn&#8217;t it natural I should
prefer you and a career to you and a baby?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not that I don&#8217;t care for children,&#8221; she murmured. Her
grey eyes grew remote; a hint of tenderness curved her lips,
and she smiled faintly to herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll try out your idea first,&#8221; he said, &#8220;&mdash;the combination
you prefer,&mdash;your work first, then me.... Our life
will pass in one endless courtship.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Could anything be lovelier!&#8221; she cried, enchanted.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">IF Annan supposed he was to see Eris frequently during
those first enchanted days, he presently realised his
mistake. She was working under pressure at the studio.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Pressure, due to laziness and ignorance, seldom bears hard
on the incompetents who cause it. In this case it was due
to hasty organization and Mr. Creevy&#8217;s direction. And Eris
was always about to take a train when Annan called her on
the telephone,&mdash;always starting &#8220;on location,&#8221; or &#8220;working
late at the studio,&#8221; or kept idle awaiting &#8220;re-takes.&#8221;</p>

<p>These phrases began to irritate Annan; but there seemed
to be nothing he could do about it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In New York, theatres were closing for the summer;
roofs and beaches opening; synthetic fruit-drinks appeared.
June did her pathetic best for the noisy, shabby city in park
and square;&mdash;put on her prettiest in green leaves and blossoms.
The Park Department ruined the effort with red
and yellow cannas. God knows whether New York&#8217;s dull
and bovine eyes notice such things at all. Does the ox notice
the wild flowers he chews, or the ass admire the thistle
blossoms before munching? But why New York is not
nauseated by its floral display remains a mystery.</p>

<p>The only dose the aborigine notices is an emetic. But
even red and yellow cannas in combination left New York&#8217;s
bowels unaffected.</p>

<p>Still, ailanthus and catalpa in Governor&#8217;s Place spread
once more their cool, green pools of shade over parched sidewalks;
ampelopsis on Annan&#8217;s house and an ancient wistaria<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
twisted over the iron balcony did their missionary part to
touch the encysted hearts of those who &#8216;have eyes but see
not.&#8217; A white butterfly or two fluttered through Governor&#8217;s
Place.</p>

<p>Annan&#8217;s house, stripped for summer, was cool and dusky
and still, haunted by a starched and female phantom that
flitted through the demi-light in eternal quest for moth and
dust and rust.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The only inclination of a man really in love is to keep at
work in the absence of the beloved. Nothing else helps to
slay the intolerable hours and days.</p>

<p>It was thus with this young man. Eris on location was
so tragic a calamity that he could endure it only by rushing
headlong into the clutch of literature.</p>

<p>All day, in dressing-gown and slippers, pen in hand, he
scratched madly at a pad.</p>

<p>Nourishment was set before him at proper intervals; he
ate it at improper intervals.</p>

<p>But the pinched look had left his youthful and agreeable
features and shadows were gone from cheek and temple.</p>

<p>Every day he wrote a morning and an evening letter to
Eris. And no doubt it was her letters to him that were
feeding him fat.</p>

<p>Sometimes Coltfoot dropped in to lounge in an arm-chair
and smoke his pipe and lazily observe the younger man,
<i>flagrante delicto</i> with his brazen Muse.</p>

<p>And once Rosalind coolly invaded his threshold, announced
with a sniff by the Starched One.</p>

<p>Rosalind wanted a cocktail and lunch. She sat on the
edge of Annan&#8217;s writing table, swinging one trim foot, interrupting
breezily when it suited her, or satisfying her capricious
curiosity with his inky copy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so bad,&#8221; she drawled, shuffling a dozen unnumbered
sheets together and tossing them under his nose. &#8220;Come on,
ducky, and talk to me ere we feast and revel.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to give you your lunch when it&#8217;s ready. Until
then I want to work. Run away and play, Linda&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Play nothing! We&#8217;re closed for the summer. Mom&#8217;s
gone to the mountains and I&#8217;m queen of the flat. I sleep
most of the time. Lay off, ducky, and converse with your
little lonely Linda&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait a second, will you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he protested. &#8220;Let my
papers alone&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not a second will I wait&mdash;not a heart-throb! Regardez-moi,
beau jeune homme. Ayez piti&eacute; de moi&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She leaned over, patted his crisp hair, joggled his pen,
gave a fillip to his nose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Betsy&#8217;s going to Paris,&#8221; she said. &#8220;What do you think
of that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you go too?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You want to get rid of me? You can&#8217;t. By the way,
how&#8217;s your solemn friend, Mr. Coltfoot?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; he murmured, scratching away on his copy.</p>

<p>&#8220;And Eris? Do you ever see her, Barry?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now and then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it all over?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your affair with her&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can it, Rosalind!&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>You&#8217;re</i> the canner, my fickle friend. We&#8217;re all pickles
and you jarred us.... Sour pickles.... When you&#8217;re
through with a girl she&#8217;s a schmeer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look at me! I&#8217;m a schmeer. I was innocent and happy
till you came schmoozing.... You know what I hear about
Eris?&#8221;</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Albert Smull is crazy about her.... He&#8217;s married, isn&#8217;t
he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re the fancy devils, aren&#8217;t they?&mdash;those red-necked,
ruddy-jowled, hand-groomed Wall Street Romeos. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
there&#8217;s just a vulgar suspicion of the natty and jaunty about
them;&mdash;and their chins are always shaved blue&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Confound it&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;can&#8217;t you let me finish
this page?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you like gossip, ducky?&#8221; she inquired with a baby
stare.</p>

<p>He lay back in his chair while a scowl struggled with an
unwilling smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;His Greatness,&#8221; she said, &#8220;looks hungry. When do we
trifle with rare wines and sparkling fruits? Oh&mdash;and that
reminds me, I want to tell you about a suitor&mdash;you know
him&mdash;Wilkes Bruce, the painter ... just to show you how
a man sometimes cans himself. There are two words that
all fakes love to hand a girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was making a hit with me at the Ritz, and I was
showing him that scarab ring you tell me is phony; and he
suddenly said those two words&mdash;said &#8217;em both in one
breath!&mdash;&#8216;<i>Indubitably</i>,&#8217; says he, &#8216;this is a <i>veritable</i> antique!&#8217;
The <i>two</i> words!... I&#8217;m off that schmeer,&#8221; she added.</p>

<p>Annan wanted to yawn but stifled the indiscretion.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know,&#8221; she drawled, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry for Eris.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, she has picked a bum in Ratford Creevy, and in
that Dutch souse, Emil Shunk. It isn&#8217;t agreeable to work
with such people.... And I fancy Smull is beginning to
bother her, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>A slight colour stained Annan&#8217;s temples: &#8220;Why do you
fancy that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know. One notices and hears. He&#8217;s always
on her heels, always schmoozing around. Of course there&#8217;s
gossip, there always is. But that&#8217;s the kind of man Smull
is.... And there you are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is he&mdash;that kind?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, he tried it on Betsy. Imagine! <i>On Betsy</i>, my
dear!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What happened?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>&#8220;Why, she told him to go to the devil. And he backing
her! Can you imagine?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope I can.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re mostly that sort, ducky&mdash;Jews and Gentiles....
It&#8217;s a good thing I have Mom. All I have to do is
whistle her. Run? It would surprise you.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Luncheon was announced.</p>

<p>He nodded, absently.... He was rather silent during
luncheon. But Rosalind departed rather pleased with herself.</p>

<p>That night, writing to Eris, he said: &#8220;If ever anything
disagreeable happens to annoy you, I want you to come to
me with it immediately.&#8221;</p>

<p>Commenting on this, from the Berkshires: &#8220;Everything is
gay and nothing is disagreeable. Mr. Smull came up and
we had a picnic near Williamstown&mdash;the jolliest party!&mdash;except
that Mr. Shunk had been drinking and Mr. Creevy&#8217;s
jokes were rather vulgar. But a girl becomes impervious to
such details. Only&mdash;I miss Frank Donnell and the nice,
clean people in Betsy&#8217;s company....&#8221;</p>

<p>That was all. And Annan, relieved, yet always vaguely
uneasy, went on with his brand new story&mdash;scratched away
at it, biding the return of Eris.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>She came when the month was nearly gone, warning him
by wire of her train, evidently not expecting him to meet
it, for she asked him to come to Jane Street for dinner at
seven.</p>

<p>He never had gone to the train to meet Eris,&mdash;had never
even thought of doing it. He thought of it now and wondered
why he never before had done so.</p>

<p>By telephone he ordered flowers to be sent to Jane Street;
and, a few minutes before six, he walked into the Grand
Central Station and was directed to the exit where the incoming
train was already signalled.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>Outside the ropes, where people had gathered to welcome
arriving friends, Annan encountered Albert Smull.
As usual they shook hands. Smull wore his habitual and
sanguine smile. His features had grown into it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Saw your good aunt at Newport, Friday,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but
I seldom see you anywhere these days, Annan.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t go about. How is it at Newport?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine weather&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Through the open gates the train
glided into view. &#8220;Thought I&#8217;d come down and see how
our picture people are looking after their tour on location,&#8221;
said Smull. &#8220;You know some of them, Annan&mdash;you&#8217;ve
met our clever little Eris?&#8221;</p>

<p>Annan turned and deliberately looked him over from his
ruddy jowls to the polished tan shoes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said slowly, &#8220;I&#8217;ve known Miss Odell for some
time. I&#8217;m here to meet her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Smull&#8217;s sanguine face slowly took on a heavier red but
the set smile remained.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bright kid,&#8221; he said, &#8220;&mdash;getting away with it, Creevy
tells me. Shill and I are putting a lot of money into this
picture&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Passengers from the train just arrived were now pouring
out of the exit, recognising waiting friends behind the
ropes, signalling them with eager gestures, hurrying around
the barriers to meet them.</p>

<p>Annan, ignoring Smull, and intently scanning the throng,
finally perceived Ratford Creevy and Emil Shunk. Behind
them, in the crowd, were other faces slightly familiar&mdash;members
of the cast&mdash;and suddenly he saw Eris in a turquoise
blue toque and summer gown, carrying her satchel,&mdash;a
lithe, buoyant figure, moving quickly through the gates
followed by a red-cap with her luggage.</p>

<p>Smull, perhaps not caring to bend too much at the waist,
went around the rope; Annan stooped under it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Barry!&#8221; she exclaimed in happy surprise.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>&#8220;It&#8217;s been a thousand years,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve a taxi
here&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Smull, smiling eagerly out of dark eyes set a trifle too
closely, and carrying his straw hat in his hand, confronted
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you do, Mr. Smull,&#8221; said Eris gaily, withdrawing
her gloved hand from Annan&#8217;s and offering it to Smull.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re looking fine, Eris,&#8221; he said, with too cordial
familiarity. &#8220;I just passed Creevy and he says everything
went big. Glad you&#8217;re back, little lady. I&#8217;ve a car here&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, Mr. Smull&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl turned to Annan: &#8220;Mr. Smull wired me that
he&#8217;d meet our train.... So thank <i>you</i>, too&mdash;for asking
me.... I&#8217;m so sorry you have troubled to keep a taxi
waiting for me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Smull, always smiling, turned to Annan: &#8220;Can&#8217;t we drop
you somewhere, old chap?&#8221;</p>

<p>Annan said: &#8220;Thanks, no.&#8221; And, looking at Eris with
cool curiosity, he took off his hat.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad you&#8217;re back,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I hope I may see
you while you&#8217;re here. Good-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-night,&#8221; she replied, as though slightly confused.</p>

<p>Annan bowed pleasantly, including them both, and turned
to the left along the rope. The girl went rather slowly away
beside Smull, followed by the red-cap with her luggage.</p>

<p>Outside the station, on the ramp above, Annan found his
taxi and got into it. All the way home he stared persistently
at the chauffeur&#8217;s frowsy head; but, whatever his thoughts,
nothing on his smoothly composed features betrayed them.</p>

<p>As he entered his house the telephone was ringing, and he
went to the lower one in the butler&#8217;s pantry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Barry!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you coming to dinner?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had expected to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Could you come <i>now</i>?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>&#8220;Where are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, at home, of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Alone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Alone!&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; she repeated. &#8220;Why, yes, of course I am
alone. I said seven, but I want you now. I can&#8217;t wait. Do
you mind?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; he said drily. At such moments, in most
young men in love, the asinine instinct dominates.</p>

<p>Still chilled by the unpleasant impression of an intimacy,
the natural existence of which he had never thought about,
he went to his room and got into a dinner jacket, sulkily.</p>

<p>As he was dressing it occurred to him that this was one
sample of the sort of thing he was very likely to encounter.
A rush of boyish jealousy and resentment flushed his face&mdash;irritation
that the world should entertain any doubt as to his
proprietary right in this girl.</p>

<p>It was high time that the world made no mistake about it.
Men of Albert Smull&#8217;s sort had better understand what was
his status vis-&agrave;-vis with Eris.</p>

<p>Intensely annoyed&mdash;and without any reason, as he realised&mdash;he
went out in a characteristically masculine frame of
mind, hailed a disreputable taxi on Greenwich Avenue, and
drove to Jane Street.</p>

<p>The declining sun, not yet low enough to transmute its
ugliness to terms Turneresque, searched out every atom of
shabbiness and squalor in the humble street. And it all
added to his sullen dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>&#8220;One thing,&#8221; he muttered; &#8220;&mdash;she&#8217;s got to get out of this
dirty district. It&#8217;s no place for the girl I&#8217;m going to marry.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Fat Hattie admitted him, simpering her welcome:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yuh flowers done come, Mistuh Annan. They&#8217;s just
grand, suh. Miss Eris she&#8217;s taking a bath. She says foh
you to go into the settin&#8217; room, Mistuh Annan. Might I
offah yuh the hospitality of some Sherry wine, Mistuh Annan?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>He declined and went in; stood looking around at the
plain, familiar place, brightened only by his flowers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Another thing,&#8221; he thought irritably, &#8220;&mdash;this installment-plan
furniture has got to go. She doesn&#8217;t seem to know
what nice things look like.... She hasn&#8217;t any comforts
in her bed-room, either. This third-rate existence has got
to stop.&#8221;</p>

<p>Unreasonably glum he picked up the evening paper, unfolded
it, stood holding it; but his gaze rested on her
closed door. Then, even as he gazed, it opened and the
girl herself came out in a soft wool robe and slippers, her
chestnut hair in lovely disorder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Darling!&#8221; she said with the breathless smile he knew so
well. &#8220;I just couldn&#8217;t wait. I was so afraid you were annoyed
with me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>His kiss made her eager explanation incoherent; she
nestled to him, dumb, happy in the physical reunion, wistful
for the spiritual, seeking it in his face with questioning grey
eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;It mustn&#8217;t happen again,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You&#8217;re mine, Eris,
and people have got to understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Darling! Of course I am. But I don&#8217;t quite see how
people are going to understand&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll talk about that this evening.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right.... Darling, I must dress. Oh, Barry, I&#8217;m
so glad&mdash;I&#8217;m always lonely without you, wherever I go!&#8221;</p>

<p>One long, deep embrace&mdash;her swift ardour leaving him
trembling&mdash;and before he knew it her door had slammed
behind her.</p>

<p>From within her bed-room: &#8220;Your letters have been so
wonderful, Barry darling! They made work delightful.&#8221;...
The excited clatter and rustle of a girl in a hurry came
indistinctly through the closed door.... &#8220;It&#8217;s a peach of
a part, Barry. There are real brains in it.... I wish I had
Frank Donnell to <i>tell</i> me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t Creevy do that?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.... He isn&#8217;t a drill-master.... Sometimes
I&#8217;m afraid he doesn&#8217;t know.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a helpless feeling, Barry. I trusted Frank. I knew
I could lean on him. But Mr. Creevy&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t much use for Creevy, either,&#8221; he said bluntly.</p>

<p>She opened the door. He found her seated before her
little mirror, tucking up stray crisp curls. She wore a mauve
dinner gown&mdash;a scant affair&mdash;as though her supple, milk-white
body were lightly sheathed in orchid petals.</p>

<p>She stretched back her head to him where he stood behind
her; he kissed her soft lips, her throat. Leaning so, against
him, she looked back again at her fresh young beauty in the
mirror.</p>

<p>&#8220;That year with Frank Donnell,&#8221; she murmured, &#8220;is saving
my very skin, now. I <i>don&#8217;t</i> know enough to go ahead
without a strong, friendly power reassuring, leading me.
Mr. Creevy lets me go my own way, or loses his temper
and shouts at me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s rather a cheap individual,&#8221; remarked Annan.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s always shouting at us.... And I haven&#8217;t much
confidence in Emil Shunk, either.... Oh, how I long for
Frank, and for that nice, kind camera-man, Stoll! To work
with gentlemen means so much to a girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It means that she can do her best work,&#8221; said Annan.
&#8220;In other words, it&#8217;s bad business to employ a pair of vulgarians
like Ratford Creevy and Emil Shunk to direct decent
people in a decent picture.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I seem to have no point of contact with them,&#8221; she
admitted. &#8220;Betsy&#8217;s company was so respectable,&mdash;and even
the Crystal Films people were so decent to me that I didn&#8217;t
expect to encounter film folk as common and horrid as I
have met.... And the Jews are no worse than the Gentiles,
Barry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentile or Jew,&#8221; he said, &#8220;&mdash;who cares in these days how
an educated gentleman worships God? But a Christian
blackguard or a Jewish blackguard, there&#8217;s the pair that are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
ruining pictures, Eris. Whether they finance a picture,
direct it, release it, exhibit it, or act in it, these two vermin
are likely to do it to death.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your profession is crawling with them. It needs delousing.
It&#8217;s all squirming with parasites. They carry
moral leprosy. They poison audiences. Some day the public
will kill them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eris stood up and linked her arms in Annan&#8217;s: &#8220;It&#8217;s so
stupid,&#8221; she said &#8220;&mdash;a wonderful art&mdash;and only in its infancy&mdash;and
already almost monopolised by beastly people....
Well, there <i>are</i> men like Frank Donnell.... And, as
for the rest of us&mdash;as far as I can judge the vast majority
among us appreciate decency and have every inclination toward
it.... I don&#8217;t know a woman in my profession who
leads an irregular life from choice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s that or quit, sometimes, I suppose,&#8221; he said gravely.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard so.... Before I knew anything I used to
hold such a girl in contempt, Barry. I know better, now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With all your passion for learning,&#8221; he said, &#8220;did you
ever suppose there was such sorry wisdom to acquire?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes. I guessed, vaguely. One can&#8217;t live in a little
village without guessing some things.... Or on a farm
without guessing the rest.... It&#8217;s best to know, always....
Lies shock me; but, do you know, truth never did.
Truth has frightened me, disgusted, angered, saddened me.
But it never shocked me yet.... I&#8217;m afraid you think me
hardened&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>His arm drew her and she turned swiftly to his lips&mdash;in
full view of Hattie in the dining-room beyond.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care,&#8221; whispered Eris, her cheeks scarlet, &#8220;&mdash;she
ought to guess what we are to each other by this time.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he seated her he said: &#8220;If she does know she knows
more than I do, Eris.... <i>What</i> are we to each other?&#8221;</p>

<p>He took his chair and she laughed at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m serious,&#8221; he repeated. &#8220;<i>What</i> are we to each other?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Darling! Are you trying to be funny?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>&#8220;Not a bit. Please answer me, Eris.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ridiculum!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Answer me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;why, you goose, we are in love with each other.
Isn&#8217;t that the answer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you engaged to me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Darling!</i>&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Are</i> you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;no.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know one reason, anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean that fellow,&#8221; he said with a shrug.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>They remained rather silent for a while. Presently he
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Merely to be in love with each other doesn&#8217;t place either
of us definitely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Place us?&#8221; she repeated, perplexed. &#8220;It places us with
each other, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But not with the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>She considered this while covers were removed and
another course laid.</p>

<p>&#8220;Darling, do you mind carving that chicken? If you don&#8217;t
want to, Hattie can take it to the kitchen&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Watch me,&#8221; he boasted, impaling the tender, roasted
bird and shaving a smoking slice from its sternum.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wonderful,&#8221; she murmured, clasping her snowy fingers;
&#8220;he knows everything, does everything. And he asks me
where it places him!... It places you, darling, like a god,
under lock and key inside the secret shrine of my innermost
heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that temple is already reserved. It&#8217;s occupied
by the real and only god you worship.... The god
of Work!&#8221;</p>

<p>After a moment she raised her eyes, tenderly apprehensive:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>&#8220;I do love you, Barry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you <i>worship</i> the other one.... You can&#8217;t serve
two gods.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I worship you, too, whatever you say!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a minor deity compared to the great god Work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Darling&mdash;don&#8217;t speak that way&mdash;even in jest&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want a shrine for myself. I won&#8217;t interfere with the
other god&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&mdash;When I tell you you&#8217;re the only man in the
world!&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want you to engage yourself to me. You can take
your time about marrying me if you&#8217;re afraid it will spoil
your career. But I want the world to know we&#8217;re engaged.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, dear?&#8221; she asked in uneasy surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because that will place us both, definitely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Goodness,&#8221; she murmured uncertainly, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t suppose
that falling in love was so complicated.... Darling!
I haven&#8217;t time to&mdash;to find out how to get rid of that man,
now; or do it, either&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will have to be done sooner or later,&#8221; he insisted.
&#8220;And that&#8217;s that, as you say.&#8221;</p>

<p>Until coffee was served they spoke rarely and of other
matters.</p>

<p>After coffee, in the living-room, she brought out a packet
of stills to show him. They went over them, minutely, consulting,
criticising, she explaining every picture and its
relation to the continuity.</p>

<p>&#8220;You should hear Mr. Creevy bellow, &#8216;Hold it! Hold it!
D&#8217;ye think I told you to shimmy?&#8217; Oh, he is rough, Barry.
The first time I heard him bawl out, &#8216;Kill that nigger!&#8217; I was
terrified: I thought there was going to be a lynching&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>They sat laughing uncontrollably at each other.</p>

<p>&#8220;You imitate Creevy&#8217;s cracked contralto voice,&#8221; said Annan.
&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know you were a mimic, Eris.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you?&#8221; And she laughed adorably. Then, suddenly,
Ratford Creevy&#8217;s high-pitched, irritated voice came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
again from her lips: &#8220;&#8216;Everybody! Everybody! Yaas, <i>you</i>,
too, you poor dumbbell! Get on there.... Eris! Eris! My
Gawd, where&#8217;s that amateur!... Well, where were you?...
Well, stand up next time.... Lights!... Hey,
where&#8217;s that amateur camera-man.... Where the hell&#8217;s
Shunk? Emil! Emil!&mdash;&mdash;&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>His laughter and her own checked her and she leaned
back, the stills sliding from her lap to the floor.</p>

<p>Together they squatted down like two children to gather
the litter of scattered photographs, interrupting to touch
lips, lightly; and finally he dumped the stills onto a table and
drew her to the lounge and gathered her close.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know, sweet, the reasonable goal of real love is
marriage. Don&#8217;t you know that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Darling!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at him uncertainly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; he insisted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sometimes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Always, ultimately. You realise that, don&#8217;t you, Eris?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Y-es.... Ultimately it&#8217;s the goal. But&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You love me enough to marry me, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not now. Ultimately.&#8221;</p>

<p>She said, pitifully: &#8220;I love you enough to marry you this
moment.... But even if I were free you wouldn&#8217;t ask it,
would you, Barry?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221; He looked intently at her. &#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t
be any use, anyway,&#8221; he concluded. &#8220;Your work is more to
you than I am. Isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl laid her face against his shoulder in silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s your ruling passion, Eris, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;suppose so.... But there never can be any other
man than you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You would make any sacrifice for your work, but you
wouldn&#8217;t sacrifice your work for me, would you, Eris?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>Her head only pressed his shoulder closer.</p>

<p>He said: &#8220;You&#8217;ve starved for your work, gone almost in
rags, slept in public parks&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d do these for you.... I&#8217;ll give you anything, do anything
for you&mdash;except&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Except give up your work,&#8221; he ended drily.</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t love you if you made me do that,&#8221; she whispered.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I <i>made</i> you do it? Do you admit I could make you
give it up?&#8221; he demanded almost arrogantly.</p>

<p>She shrugged slightly: then raised her head and looked
dumbly into his hard eyes.</p>

<p>There are dumb creatures that let themselves be slain
without resistance; but in their doomed eyes is something
that the slayer never, never can forget.</p>

<p>And, as Annan looked at this girl, something of his
masculine egotism and arrogance became troubled.</p>

<p>He said in a more subdued voice: &#8220;After you are firmly
established in your profession, we can think about marriage,
can&#8217;t we?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I always think about it.... I often wonder if you can
wait.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose that I must.... How long, Eris?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.... Darling! I don&#8217;t know&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Suddenly she took his head in her arms and kissed him
passionately, strained him to her convulsively.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want you to have a living corpse for a wife,&#8221;
she said tremulously. &#8220;That&#8217;s what I&#8217;d be if I stopped work
now. I&#8217;d be a dead, inert, mindless thing. I couldn&#8217;t love.
Let us go on this way. I must have my freedom.... I&#8217;ll
come to you when I&#8217;m ready, Barry.... There&#8217;ll come a
time when I&#8217;ll have to have you to go on at all. I&#8217;ll not be
able to work without you.... There&#8217;ll come such a time....
Then, if I don&#8217;t have you, I shall be unable to work
at all.... Work will stop. I <i>know</i> it.... If only you
will understand....&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>It seemed that he did understand. He said he did, anyway.
But he also wanted their engagement to be understood.
And she promised him to consult his lawyer as soon
as work permitted and find out what could be done to eliminate
from her life the last traces of Eddie Carter, alias E.
Stuart Graydon.</p>

<p>For Eris never expected to lay eyes again upon the nimble
Mr. Graydon.</p>

<p>But it is the unexpected that usually happens, particularly
if it&#8217;s disagreeable.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXV</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">HER first picture&mdash;from a popular novel of the hour
called &#8220;The Bird of Prey&#8221;&mdash;was finished and ready
for cutting, except for picking up a mass of ragged
ends.</p>

<p>Few sets had been knocked down, for there were re-takes
necessary&mdash;accidents due to Shunk or to Creevy, and charged
to everybody else from door-keeper to star.</p>

<p>The barn-like studio was in disorder and it rang all day
with a hell of dissonance&mdash;infernal hammering, trample of
heavy feet, the racket of hoarse voices, scrape of props and
electric cables over the wood flooring, and the high-pitched,
spiteful scolding of Ratford Creevy&mdash;as though a noisy
mouth could ever remedy confusion resulting from mental
incapacity.</p>

<p>Smull came every day to take Eris to lunch&mdash;such frequent
consultation being both customary and advisable, he
informed her.</p>

<p>As a result the girl was a target for gossip and curiosity,
sneered at by some, leered at by others, but generally fawned
on because of suspected &#8220;pull with the main guy.&#8221; Courted,
flattered, deferred to by one and all, she was inexperienced
enough to believe in such universal friendliness, innocent
enough to entertain no suspicion of these less-fortunates who
were kind to her; of Albert Smull&#8217;s unvarying and eager
cordiality.</p>

<p>The girl was radiantly happy, despite misgivings regarding
Mr. Creevy.</p>

<p>And, as far as that gentleman&#8217;s incompetence was concerned,
although she did not know it she was learning a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
courage and self-reliance that had been slower coming if
she had remained under the direction of Frank Donnell.</p>

<p>Artistically, intellectually, Eris, from sheer necessity, had
made, unconsciously, a vast advance amid obstacles and conditions
that always worried and sometimes dismayed her.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact she had taught more to Creevy than
he had ever taught anybody.</p>

<p>Like a good field-dog, the bird-sense and instinct being
there, with a little training she had begun to instruct her instructor
in qualities and in technique entirely unfamiliar yet
astonishingly sound.</p>

<p>A mean mind accepts but resents. Creevy said to Smull,
with sufficient cunning to insure further employment:</p>

<p>&#8220;She takes her head and wears me out. Full of pep but
don&#8217;t know anything. All the same, I&#8217;d rather handle that
kind. If you want me to go on with her I&#8217;ll guarantee her.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Smull was fretting about the overhead. He had the
financier&#8217;s capacity for detail. He prowled about the studio&mdash;when
he could take his eager gaze off of Eris&mdash;prying,
peeping, mousing, snooping, asking misleading questions of
employees, gradually informing himself.</p>

<p>He put Creevy on the rack over the books. He told him,
always with his fixed and sanguine smile, that the footage
was forty per cent. unnecessary. He compared the cost
of sets to Frank Donnell&#8217;s bill; the cost of transportation to
the same item in Betsy Blythe&#8217;s company. Creevy writhed,
not daring to show resentment.</p>

<p>But he did worse; he pointed out that Betsy Blythe had
a limousine listed on Frank Donnell&#8217;s account, and that he
had cut that out of the perquisites of Eris and substituted
a taxi.</p>

<p>Of course Smull knew that. He had connived at this petty
economy, but only partly from meanness; for it gave him a
better excuse to offer his own car. And he cared nothing
about the girl&#8217;s convenience.</p>

<p>He said to Creevy: &#8220;You start in and clean up this picture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
by the end of the week. You begin to cut Monday
next.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, Mr. Smull. But I better start Marc Blither
on the next&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What next?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The next picture. You have the continuity and director&#8217;s
script&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I may give it to Frank Donnell. There may not be
another Odell picture,&#8221; said Smull, smiling fixedly.</p>

<p>Creevy said nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Usually,&#8221; added Smull, &#8220;I make up my mind at my own
convenience and to please myself,&mdash;not others.&#8221;</p>

<p>He got up from the rickety chair, walked to the outer
door of the dressing rooms, and sent word to Eris that his
car was waiting to take her to luncheon.</p>

<p>She appeared presently without her make-up, Creevy being
uncertain that he wanted her during the afternoon, but insisting
that she &#8220;stick around.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As they went down the steps to the car&mdash;a glittering affair
with two men on the box&mdash;Smull took the girl familiarly
by the arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to talk over the next picture with you this
evening,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m asking Frank Donnell to dine with
me at my rooms. Will you come?&#8221;</p>

<p>She halted at the open door of the car and gave him a
surprised and happy look.</p>

<p>&#8220;Frank Donnell? I&#8217;d love to come. But, Mr. Smull!&mdash;you
don&#8217;t mean that Mr. Donnell is to direct <i>me</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll see,&#8221; he smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;Betsy! I <i>couldn&#8217;t</i> do that to <i>her</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>Or to anybody, she might have added. But the mere
thought of Frank Donnell brought pleasure and gratitude.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re so wonderfully kind, Mr. Smull,&#8221; she said with
another radiant look as he aided her to enter the car.</p>

<p>As he got in after her a pallid, shabby man across the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
street watched her intently. He seemed interested in Smull,
too, and in the shining car, and even in the license number.
And he stood looking after it as long as it remained in
sight.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That afternoon Eris sat idle in her dressing-room, reading,
or wandered about among electric cables and lumber
and sets while Mr. Creevy tried to fill in and supplement
poor directorship with little fiddling re-takes.</p>

<p>Emil Shunk, the camera-man, slightly drunk, had turned
very sulky. Most of the afternoon was wasted in futile
altercation with Creevy, until the latter, exasperated, dismissed
everybody.</p>

<p>The taxi allotted to Eris took her back to the city, tired,
disgusted, and a little nervous.</p>

<p>The last profane scene between Creevy and Shunk, her
all-day idleness, the stifling summer heat in the studio, the
jolting drive back to New York through the squalor of the
river-front, all these left her tired and depressed.</p>

<p>In her own apartment, bathed, freshened of the city&#8217;s
penetrating grime, and now at her ease in a cool morning
wrap, she sipped the tea that Hattie brought and then
stretched out on the sofa, thankful to rest body and mind.</p>

<p>For a wonder, Jane Street was quiet that hot afternoon.
The blessed stillness healed her ears of the blows of sound;
she lay in the pleasant demi-light of lowered shades, disinclined
to stir, to speak, to think.</p>

<p>But thinking can be stopped only by sleep. She remembered
that she was to call Annan when she got home. Somehow
she didn&#8217;t feel like it.</p>

<p>Lying there, her hands clasped under her chestnut curls,
grey eyes widely remote, the idle thoughts went drifting
through her mind, undirected, unchecked.</p>

<p>Visions of the past glimmered, went out, followed by
others that floated by like phantoms&mdash;glimpses of Whitewater
Farms, of her father in his spotless milking jacket,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
of a girl standing with ears stopped and eyes desperately
shut while the great herd-bull died.</p>

<p>Tinted spectres of village people she had known rose,
slipped away, faded, vanished;&mdash;Mazie&#8217;s three uncouth sons,
Si, Willis, and Buddy&mdash;all already unreal to her, as though
she merely had heard of them;&mdash;Dr. Wand, Dr. Benson, Ed.
Lister, always redolent of fertilizer;&mdash;the minister, &#8220;Rev.
Stiles&#8221;;&mdash;and then, unbidden, into her mind&#8217;s vague picture
stepped a trim, graceful, polite young man with agreeable
voice and long, clever fingers always stained with nicotine or
acid&mdash;</p>

<p>The girl sat up abruptly; cleared her eyes of tangled curls
with a sudden sweep of her slim hand as though to brush
away the vision.</p>

<p>As she looked over her left shoulder at the mantle clock
her telephone rang.</p>

<p>She sprang up, suddenly aware that she had but a few
minutes to dress and go to meet Frank Donnell at the apartment
of Albert Smull.</p>

<p>It was Annan on the wire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, dearest,&#8221; she said, stifling the yawn that had been
threatening since she aroused herself from her torpor.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you were to call me when you got home,&#8221; he
said in a dismal voice that sounded rather hollow to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Forgive me, Barry dear. I was rather fagged and I
just lay down on the sofa. And I nearly had a nightmare.... Are
you well, darling?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m seriously ill and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; she exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dying&mdash;to see you, Eris.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t joke that way; you startle me,&#8221; she said
with a quick breath of relief.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you wear black for me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t make a jest of it&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You sweet little thing,&#8221; he said, &#8220;will you dine at my
place, or out, or shall I come&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>&#8220;Darling! I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t made an engagement, have you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I have, dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221; he asked impatiently. It was none of his business.
But she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Smull asked me to dine with him and Frank Donnell.
Are you going to be lonely, dear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are you dining?&#8221; he demanded impatiently.</p>

<p>She did not resent it: &#8220;In Mr. Smull&#8217;s apartment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think that&#8217;s the thing to do?&#8221; he asked sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Darling! Isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you accustomed to dine with married men in apartments
which they maintain outside their homes?&#8221;</p>

<p>His anger and insolence merely astonished her:</p>

<p>&#8220;Barry dear,&#8221; she said, &#8220;it is merely a business matter.
He asked me to meet Frank there and discuss my next picture.
I can&#8217;t understand why you seem offended&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think it&#8217;s agreeable for me to expect an evening
with you, and suddenly discover that you have arranged to
pass it with Albert Smull?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry.... I can&#8217;t very well help it&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s perfectly rotten of you!&#8221; he retorted in a blaze of
boyish temper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Barry dear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t talk that way to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then don&#8217;t deserve it&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Barry!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; There was a pause. He waited. Then her
voice, rather low and quiet:</p>

<p>&#8220;To control my own temper it is necessary for me to
keep reminding myself that you love me.... Perhaps you
wouldn&#8217;t speak that way if you didn&#8217;t.... Perhaps men
are that way.... I&#8217;m sorry I&#8217;m not dining with you....
I&#8217;m sorry because I&#8217;m in love with you.... And always
will be.... Good-night, dear.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>&#8220;Eris!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m ashamed&mdash;penitent&mdash;miserable. I&#8217;m rottenly jealous&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Darling! You have no cause&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. But&mdash;I can&#8217;t bear to think of you alone with other
men. I know it&#8217;s all right. I know also that jealousy is a
low-down, common, disgusting, contemptible emotion&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Barry! I <i>want</i> you to be properly jealous of my safety
and well-being. I adore it in you, you funny, delightful boy!
I&#8217;m not experienced with men, but I&#8217;m beginning to understand
you. Darling! You may even swear at me if
you want to&mdash;if you do it&#8217;s because you&#8217;re in love
with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl, laughing, heard the boy sigh: &#8220;It&#8217;s doing queer
things to me,&#8221; he said, &#8220;&mdash;this love business. All I can
think of is you; and when you&#8217;re away I just dope myself
with work.... I don&#8217;t mean to be selfish&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I <i>want</i> you to be. Be a perfect pig if you like, darling.
Bully me, threaten, monopolise me&mdash;oh, my dear, my dear,
give me my allotted time to work, learn, and make good;
and then I promise&mdash;I <i>promise</i> you all that is within me to
give&mdash;mind and soul, Barry&mdash;utter devotion, gratitude unmeasured,
all, all of me&mdash;darling!&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She was late,&mdash;nearly three-quarters of an hour late, when
she arrived at Albert Smull&#8217;s apartment on Park Avenue.</p>

<p>A man servant directed her to a rear room fitted amazingly
like the boudoirs she had read about.</p>

<p>It was a charming place hung with a sort of silvery rose-silk;
and on an ivory-tinted dresser everything that femininity
could require, brand new and sealed.</p>

<p>But Eris spent only a moment at the mirror, and, the next,
she was shaking hands with Albert Smull in a delightful
lounging room, slightly aromatic with a melange of flowers
and tobacco.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry to be late,&#8221; she said with smiling concern,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
&#8220;but I&#8217;m so relieved to find that Mr. Donnell hasn&#8217;t yet arrived.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We won&#8217;t wait dinner for him anyway,&#8221; said Smull
with his near and eager smile. &#8220;He&#8217;ll have to take his
chances, Eris.... I say, you&#8217;re stunning in that gown!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, do you like it?&#8221; she said politely.</p>

<p>He repeated emphatically his admiration; seemed inclined
to touch the black fabric; expatiate on fashion, suitability,
harmony of snowy skin, red hair, and the smartness of dead
black&mdash;&#8220;Only the young dare wear it, and usually they&#8217;re too
stupid to until they&#8217;re too old to.&#8221;</p>

<p>A grave-faced servant brought three cocktails.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, now, Eris, it&#8217;s time you learned,&#8221; he insisted.
&#8220;Be a good fellow and you won&#8217;t be sorry. I&#8217;ve got to
drink Frank&#8217;s cocktail anyway. You&#8217;ll have it on your
conscience if I have to drink yours too!&#8221;</p>

<p>To be rid of his insistence she touched her lips to her
glass, set it back on the tray, and wiped her lips when he
wasn&#8217;t looking.</p>

<p>Smull&#8217;s ruddy visage was ruddier after the third cocktail.
The grave servant opened two folding glass doors; Smull
gave his arm to Eris.</p>

<p>Everything in the dining-room was suffused in a glow
merciful to age and exquisitely transfiguring mortal youth
into angelic immortality.</p>

<p>The sheer beauty of the flowers, of the silver and glass;
the white walls, the antique splendour of mirror and painting
entranced the girl.</p>

<p>Faultlessly chosen, perfectly served, the dinner progressed
gaily, and without the visible embarrassment of Eris who,
however, was conscious of a vague uneasiness, and who
wondered why Frank Donnell did not arrive.</p>

<p>There was champagne. She touched the glass with her
lips, but all his gay cajolery and persuasion could not induce
her to do more.</p>

<p>She glanced at his face from time to time, noticing the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
deepening colour with curiosity but without uneasiness; always
politely returning the fixed smile that never left those
two little blackish brown eyes set a trifle too close together.</p>

<p>Politely, too, she awaited Smull&#8217;s introduction of the subject
matter to be discussed&mdash;the reason, in fact, and the
excuse for her presence at this man&#8217;s table.</p>

<p>But Smull talked of other matters,&mdash;trivial matters,&mdash;such
as her personal beauty; the personal success she might make
over sentimental men if she chose; the certain surprise and
jealousy of other women&mdash;but what women, and of what
sort he did not specify or make very clear.</p>

<p>&#8220;You ought to get on,&#8221; he said, almost grinning.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m trying to,&#8221; she laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, sure. I mean&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; But what he meant seemed to
expire on his heavy lips as though lack of vocabulary, or
perhaps of assurance, left him dumb for the moment.</p>

<p>She wondered why Frank didn&#8217;t arrive. Coffee was now
to be served in the lounge, which was part library, part living-room.</p>

<p>Eris understood she was to rise: Smull joined her with his
familiar arm taking possession of hers. His large, hot hand
made her a little uncomfortable and she was glad to
free her bare arm and retire with her coffee to a solitary
arm-chair.</p>

<p>The grave-faced servant seemed to know what to bring to
Mr. Smull in addition to the frozen mint offered to Eris&mdash;and
smilingly declined.</p>

<p>After the grave one had retired with the empty coffee
cups and had closed the folding glass doors, Eris looked enquiringly
at Mr. Smull, awaiting the broaching of what most
closely concerned her.</p>

<p>But Smull, half draining his frosted glass, assumed a familiarity
almost boisterous.</p>

<p>&#8220;See here, Eris, you&#8217;re not going to get on unless you&#8217;re
a good fellow. You&#8217;re not going to get anywhere if you
don&#8217;t learn to keep up your end.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>&#8220;If you mean cocktails and champagne,&#8221; she said, laughing,
&#8220;I can&#8217;t help not liking them, can I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly you can. Once you get the first glass down
you&#8217;ll begin to like it. Come on, Eris! Show your pep.
I&#8217;ll have Harvey bring you some champagne&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m wondering,&#8221; she said, &#8220;why Frank Donnell doesn&#8217;t
come. Have you any idea, Mr.&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked up as she spoke, and fell silent. Smull&#8217;s fixed
smile had become a fixed grin. Out of a red, puffy face two
darkish little eyes rested on her with disconcerting intentness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, Eris, we don&#8217;t need Frank Donnell. It&#8217;s up
to me, after all. Isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Her lips unclosed, a trifle stiffly: &#8220;Why yes, I suppose
so&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well then!&#8221;</p>

<p>She met his grin with a forced smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; she enquired, &#8220;have you chosen to discuss matters
with me alone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You bet. That&#8217;s right, Eris. That&#8217;s what. You get
my first curve for a homer, little girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>He hunched his chair nearer to hers: &#8220;Look here, Eris;
you can have pretty nearly what you want out of me. You
want your own company for keeps? O. K.! You want
to pick your director and your camera-man? That&#8217;s O. K.
You want Frank Donnell? Sure!&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Betsy&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry. I pay his salary. I pay hers, too. If you
want Frank&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t. I wouldn&#8217;t do such a thing&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Puff! She&#8217;d do it to you. Didn&#8217;t she put you out of
her company!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She was right. It was perfectly understood by me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, sweetness, don&#8217;t you let anybody put that over.
Betsy couldn&#8217;t stand your competition and she canned you.
Now you can get back.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>&#8220;Thank you, Mr. Smull, but I couldn&#8217;t.... Not that
I&mdash;I care for Mr. Creevy very much&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bing! He&#8217;s out! Who do you want?&#8221; He hunched his
chair closer: &#8220;And say, sweetness, are you getting enough
per?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you satisfied with your contract?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean you don&#8217;t want a raise?&#8221;</p>

<p>She said, rather bewildered: &#8220;I have signed for three
years&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Blaa! What&#8217;s a contract! You can have them both.
Stick &#8217;em in the fire. Is that right?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen, my dear. You ought to get what Blythe&#8217;s
getting the first year. After that we&#8217;ll see. What do you
say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is too kind of you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me worry over that. Are we set? You have what
you want&mdash;anything you want. You fix it up and I&#8217;ll O. K.
it. Is that right, sweetheart?&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl looked at him in a dazed way. He left his seat,
came over, seated himself on the arm of her chair. As she
rose, instinctively, his arm brushed her bare shoulder.</p>

<p>And now he also stood up, his hot, red features, and the
grin and the little darkish eyes very close to her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;See here, Eris,&#8221; he said thickly, &#8220;I&#8217;m crazy about you.&#8221;</p>

<p>A slight chill possessed her, but she was calm enough.
She said: &#8220;I&#8217;d rather not understand you, Mr. Smull.&#8221;</p>

<p>The grin never altered: &#8220;Why not?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;For one thing, if you honestly cared for me you wouldn&#8217;t
have brought me here alone to say so.... For another&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
she looked at him curiously; &#8220;&mdash;you are married,
aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that going to matter when a man&#8217;s crazy about
you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>&#8220;Slightly,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;&mdash;Crazy enough,&#8221; he went on, ignoring her comment,
&#8220;&mdash;crazy enough to tell you to hand yourself whatever you
fancy? Do you get me right? You can have whatever&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want anything,&#8221; she said wearily, moving toward
the door.</p>

<p>He made the mistake of laying hands on her&mdash;hot, red,
puffy hands; and she struck him across his fixed grin with
all her strength.</p>

<p>Breathless, motionless, they fell back, still confronted. A
streak of bright blood divided his chin, running down from
his mouth, dripping faster and faster to the rug.</p>

<p>He got out his handkerchief, staunched the flow, spoke
while the handkerchief grew sopping red:</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right, sweetness. Sorry I was premature. You
take your time about it&mdash;take all the time you need. Then
give me my answer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll give it to you now,&#8221; she said unsteadily.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want it now, Eris&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; She smiled: &#8220;You&#8217;ve
already had part of it. The rest is this: I&#8217;m engaged&mdash;or
practically so&mdash;to a man I&#8217;m going to marry some day....
And, as to what you&#8217;ve said and done this evening, I&#8217;m not
very much shocked. They said you were that kind. You
look it.... I&#8217;m not angry, either. The whole affair is so
petty. And you don&#8217;t seem to know any better. I think,&#8221;
she added, &#8220;that I&#8217;m more bored than annoyed. Good-night,
Mr. Smull.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eris!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I were divorced would you marry me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said contemptuously. &#8220;And that&#8217;s <i>that</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>To the man at the hall door she said: &#8220;Please call a taxi
for Miss Odell,&#8221; and passed on to the silver-rose boudoir
where she took her scarf and reticule from a chair and tossed
Smull&#8217;s orchids onto the dresser.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>&#8220;Oh, dear,&#8221; she thought to herself, &#8220;&mdash;such cheap, such
petty wickedness! If I&#8217;m out of a job it will complete the
burlesque.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the hall door the servant had vanished and Smull stood
waiting.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Eris,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, too. You won&#8217;t want me for another picture,
I suppose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you stay?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have to, don&#8217;t I? There&#8217;s my contract, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good God, Eris, I didn&#8217;t realise I loved you seriously.
I&#8217;m half-crazed by this; I&mdash;I don&#8217;t know what to do&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then let me suggest that you talk it over with your
wife,&#8221; she said. &#8220;That ought to be a household remedy for
you, Mr. Smull.&#8221;</p>

<p>She passed him, stepped to the lift, rang, turned and
laughed at him with all the insolence of virgin intolerance.</p>

<p>&#8220;You little slut,&#8221; he said in a distinct voice that quivered,
&#8220;I don&#8217;t get you but you&#8217;ve played me for a sucker. You&#8217;re
out! Do you get that? Now run to your Kike attorney
with your contract!&mdash;God damn your soul!&#8221;</p>

<p>As she stepped into the lift she thought: &#8220;&mdash;Burlesque and
all.&#8221; But the strain was telling and she was close to tears
as she went out into Park Avenue and got wearily into her
taxi-cab.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, dear,&#8221; she said in a low voice. &#8220;Oh, dear.&#8221; But
reaction was tiring her to the edge of drowsiness. She
yawned, wiped the unshed tears from her eyes with her wisp
of a handkerchief, yawned again, and lay back in the cab
closing the grey virgin eyes that had looked into hell and
found the spectacle a cheap burlesque.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">IT was not yet ten o&#8217;clock when Eris arrived at Jane
Street. Gutters stank; the heated darkness reeked with
the stench of stables, slops, and unwashed human bodies.</p>

<p>Sidewalks still swarmed; tenements had muted and disgorged;
every alley spewed women and men in every stage
of undress. Fat females with babies at breasts squatted beside
dirty doorsteps; dishevelled hags hung out of open windows,
frowsy men sprawled on chairs, or nude to the trousers,
looked down from rusting fire-escapes at a screaming
tumult of half-naked children shouting and dancing in the
cataract of spray from a hose which two firemen had opened
on them from a hydrant.</p>

<p>Flares burning redly on push-carts threw smoky glares
here and there as far as Greenwich Avenue, where the light-smeared
darkness was turbulent with human herd.</p>

<p>Into this dissonance and clamour, clothed in silk, came
Eris, daughter of Discord. As in a walking dream she
descended from her taxi; fumbled in her silken reticule to
find the fare; paid, scarcely knowing what she was paying.</p>

<p>As she turned and ascended the low steps of her house,
still searching about in the reticule for her latch-key, she
became aware that a man was standing in the vestibule.</p>

<p>When she found her latch-key she glanced up at the
shadowy shape.</p>

<p>Then the man uttered her name.</p>

<p>Instantly his voice awoke in her ears that alarming echo
which sometimes haunted her dreams. And though the
man&#8217;s features were only a grey blur in the obscurity, she
knew him absolutely.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>For an instant all her strength seemed to leave her body,
and she sagged a little, sideways, resting against the vestibule
wall.</p>

<p>The shock lasted but a second; blood rushed to her face;
without a word she straightened up, stepped forward, refitted
her latch-key.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eris,&#8221; he whimpered, &#8220;won&#8217;t you speak to me?&#8221;</p>

<p>As she wrenched open the front door, light from the hall
gas-jet fell across the man&#8217;s pale visage, revealing his collarless
shirt and shabby clothes.</p>

<p>Already she had set foot inside. Perhaps the ghastly
pallor of the man halted her&mdash;perhaps some occult thing
within the law held her fettered in chains invisible. She
stood with head averted, dumb, motionless, grasping her key
convulsively.</p>

<p>&#8220;My God,&#8221; he whispered, &#8220;won&#8217;t you even look at
me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you want?&#8221; she asked in the ghost of a voice.
Then, slowly, she turned and looked at her husband.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sick&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He leaned weakly against the vestibule
door, and she saw his closing eyes and the breath labouring
and heaving his bony chest.</p>

<p>What was this miserable creature to her, who had cheated
her girlhood and struck her a blow that never could entirely
heal?</p>

<p>What had she to do with any sickness of this man and
his poverty and misery?</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should you&mdash;come&mdash;to me?&#8221; she asked. Suddenly
she felt her body quivering all over. &#8220;What do I
owe to you?&#8221; she cried, revolted.</p>

<p>He muttered something;&mdash;&#8220;In sickness and in health&mdash;till&mdash;till
death do us&mdash;part&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>A dry sob checked his mumbling. He shook his head,
slightly. His heavy eyes closed.</p>

<p>She stood staring at him and holding the door partly
open. Twice she clutched the knob in nervous fingers as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
though to slam the door in his face and bolt out this pallid
spectre of the past. She could not stir.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the matter with you?&#8221; she finally forced herself
to ask.</p>

<p>He opened his sick eyes: &#8220;Hunger&mdash;I guess&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may have money if you need it. Is that what you
want?&#8221;</p>

<p>He seemed to summon strength to stand upright and pass
his bloodless fingers over his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right,&#8221; he muttered thickly; &#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean to
bother you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned as though to go, steadying himself with one
shaky hand on the stoop railing. At the door-step he
stumbled, swayed, but recovered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stuart!&#8221; she burst out, &#8220;come back!&#8221;</p>

<p>He pulled himself together; turned toward her: &#8220;I don&#8217;t
want money.... I&#8217;m too sick&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait! You can&#8217;t go into the street that way!...&#8221;</p>

<p>He seemed so shaky and confused that she took hold of
his ragged arm. Very slowly, and supported by her, he
entered the doorway. They climbed the stairs together,
wearily, in silence.</p>

<p>Hattie usually went home at night and arrived, by key,
early in the morning. Eris unlocked her door, lighted the
corridor, went on to the living-room and lighted that. Then
she returned to her husband and led the way to the kitchen
and pantry and lighted them both.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a chair,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll make you some hot
coffee.&#8221;</p>

<p>She flung a cloth over the kitchen table, laid a cover,
brought what there was in the ice-box,&mdash;cold lamb, sardines,
butter, fruit. She went again to the pantry and
sliced bread for him. Then she started the gas range in the
kitchen.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m putting you to a great deal of trouble,&#8221; he mumbled.</p>

<p>She paid him no attention but went on with her preparations.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
When finally she returned with the steaming coffee
she found he had eaten nothing.</p>

<p>However, he drank some of the coffee. After that
he slumped on his chair, dazed, inert, his lack-lustre gaze
on the floor. But his bony, bloodless fingers&mdash;those
long, clever, nimble fingers she remembered&mdash;picked aimlessly
at everything&mdash;at his face, at his clothing, at the sliced
bread.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you been ill long?&#8221; she forced herself to ask.</p>

<p>He mumbled something. She bent nearer to understand,
but he fell silent, continuing to pick and fumble and stare at
space.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you feel very ill, Stuart? I want you to tell me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I could have&mdash;a little whiskey&mdash;or something&mdash;to
buck up&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She rose, got the gift bottle that she had been saving;
brought it to him with a tumbler; left him there
with it.</p>

<p>As she turned her back and walked nervously toward the
front of the house, he peeped after her out of shadowy
eyes, not lifting his head. Then he poured out half a glass
of neat whiskey, steadily enough, swallowed it, looked
around.</p>

<p>In the living-room Eris flung scarf and reticule on the
sofa, stood for a moment twisting her fingers in helpless
revolt; then, fighting off nervous reaction, she paced the
room striving to think what to do, what was right to do in
this miserable emergency.</p>

<p>Did she owe this man anything more than she owed to
any sick, hungry, ragged man? If so, <i>what</i>? How much?
How far did the law run that fettered her? What were
the statutes which exacted service? And the ethics of the
case&mdash;what were they? Anything except the bare morals
involved? Anything except the ordinary humanity operating
generally in such cases and involving her in obvious
obligation? Were they the obligations which once involved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
those who looked upon Lazarus and &#8220;passed by on the other
side&#8221;? Were they really more vital?</p>

<p>She went slowly back to the kitchen. Hearing her approach,
her husband had crossed both arms on the table
and dropped his marred face in them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you really very ill, Stuart?&#8221; she asked calmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. I&#8217;ll go&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He tried, apparently, to get to his
feet; fell back on the chair, whimpering.</p>

<p>There was a small room off the pantry where, in emergency,
Hattie sometimes slept on a box-couch.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can lie down there for a while if you wish,&#8221; she
said. She helped him get up; he stumbled toward the
pantry, guided by her, to the couch in the little room beyond.
Here he sank down and dropped his head between his hands.
She had turned to leave but halted and looked back at him
from the pantry doorway.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had better call a physician,&#8221; she said, frightened by his
deathly colour.</p>

<p>He might have explained that his pasty skin was partly
due to prison pallor, partly to drugs. Instead he asked
for a little more whiskey.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want a doctor,&#8221; he muttered; &#8220;I&#8217;ll be all right
after a nap. This whiskey will pull me together.... You
go to bed.&#8221;</p>

<p>After a while he looked up at her, rested so, his shadowy
eyes fixed on her with a sort of stealthy intentness.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better sleep if you can,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll have to
wake you soon. It is growing very late.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh God!&#8221; he burst out suddenly, &#8220;what a wreck I&#8217;ve
made of our lives!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not of mine,&#8221; she retorted coolly; and turned to
leave.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; he whined. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean to get you in
wrong.... I meant to go straight after we were married....
But they got me wrong, Eris, they got me wrong!...
It was the very last job I ever meant to do.... I gave up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
the plates. That&#8217;s how they let me off with a light one....
I&#8217;m out over a month, now&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Were you in&mdash;in <i>prison</i>!&#8221; she demanded with an overwhelming
surge of disgust.</p>

<p>He began to snivel: &#8220;You couldn&#8217;t get over <i>that</i>, could
you, Eris?... And what I did to you&mdash;getting you in
wrong&mdash;disgracing you that way&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She made no answer but her grey eyes grew cold.</p>

<p>&#8220;You couldn&#8217;t ever forgive me, could you, Eris?&#8221; he
whimpered, watching her intently.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can forget you, in time, if you keep away from me....
But&mdash;it is terrible to see you&mdash;<i>terrible</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>He licked his dry lips, furtively, always watching her.</p>

<p>&#8220;If ever you would let me try to make amends&mdash;if you&#8217;d
just let me work for you,&mdash;slave for you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>For an instant she stared at him, incredulous that she had
heard correctly. Then wrath set her cheeks ablaze: but
her voice remained controlled, and she chose and measured
her words:</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen to me, Stuart: I wouldn&#8217;t let you lift a finger
for me; I wouldn&#8217;t let you touch me,&mdash;I don&#8217;t expect ever
to see you again,&mdash;I don&#8217;t want even to hear of you. And
that&#8217;s <i>that</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you hate me so bitterly, Eris?&#8221; he whimpered,
cringing but always watching her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t hate. For what you did to an ignorant girl&mdash;for
your deception, your meanness, your lying, I have no
<i>hatred</i>. I don&#8217;t hate: I merely rid myself of what offends
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He began to snivel again, seated on the edge of the box-couch,
swaying from side to side:</p>

<p>&#8220;I know I shouldn&#8217;t have married you. But I wanted to
go straight. I was madly in love with you, Eris&mdash;and I
haven&#8217;t changed. Haven&#8217;t you a word for me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She gazed at him with a loathing in which no saving
spark of anger mitigated the cold disgust. She said, slowly:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>&#8220;All I need ever say to you can be said through a lawyer.
That is all that concerns you. If you wish to lie down, do
so. I don&#8217;t want you here; but I wouldn&#8217;t turn a sick
snake out of doors.&#8221;</p>

<p>She left him and went back to her bed-room. For an
hour she sat there, unstirring, waiting, listening at moments.
The flush remained on her cheeks; and into her eyes there
came a glint at times, as where storms brood behind grey
horizons.</p>

<p>The day, indeed, had bred storms for Eris&mdash;for Eris,
daughter of Discord&mdash;sitting here in her dim chamber all
alone.</p>

<p>Twice after midnight she had gone to the little room off
the pantry, only to find her husband heavily asleep. He
seemed so wretched a thing, so broken, so haggard, that
she had yet not found courage to awake him and send him
into the street.</p>

<p>So now, once more, she returned to her bed-room and
her sombre vigil; sat there brooding, waiting, listening at
intervals, wondering what to do, and how, and when.</p>

<p>The fatigue of that unhappy day had strained her nerves,
not her courage. But for the advent of this miserable man
she would have had leisure to think about what was to be
done for the future and face the fact that she was out of
work.</p>

<p>Now she felt too weary to think&mdash;too tired to examine
the situation which so suddenly confronted her when Albert
Smull flung his last insult in her shrinking face.</p>

<p>Troubles thickened about her; trouble was invading her
very door; but she was too sleepy to consider the misfortunes
that involved her&mdash;the menacing situation at the
studio&mdash;the sordid problem in the next room.</p>

<p>Her little mantel-clock struck two o&#8217;clock before she
finally summoned energy to rise and go to awaken her
husband.</p>

<p>He seemed to be in a sort of coma. Only after she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
twitched his sleeve repeatedly did he unclose his dangerous
eyes. And then he merely muttered fretfully that he was
too weak to move and meant to sleep where he lay until
morning.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t remain here all night,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I can&#8217;t
permit that. Do you understand, Stuart?&#8221;</p>

<p>But he only turned over, muttering incoherencies, and
buried his dishevelled head in his ragged arms.</p>

<p>Not knowing what to do, she went wearily back to her
bed-room. Twice, trying to think what to do, she fell
asleep in her chair. The second waking found her on her
feet, blind with sleep, but with instinct leading her to lock
and bolt her bed-room door.... That is the last she remembered
for a while.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>She awoke, lying diagonally across her bed, fully dressed,
in the dull, rosy glow of her little night-lamp. Something
was scraping and scratching at her door. She turned her
head, saw the door-knob twisting very softly, now this
way, now that.</p>

<p>She got up from the bed and went quickly to the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t leave this house,&#8221; she said in a low voice,
&#8220;I shall telephone for a policeman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Take me back, Eris,&#8221; he whined. &#8220;As God sees me, I
love you! I&#8217;ll work my fingers to the bone for you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Leave this house,&#8221; she repeated.</p>

<p>He tried the door again, gently, then wrenched at the
knob. Suddenly he threw his full weight against the door.
But they wrought well in the days when that old house was
built.</p>

<p>Listening, she heard him moving off, softly, and realised
he had removed his shoes.</p>

<p>For a long while she continued to listen, but heard no
further sound from him. There was not the slightest sense
of fear in her, merely loathing and weariness unutterable.</p>

<p>She went back, finally, to the bed and lay down across it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>Four o&#8217;clock struck in the living-room. After that she
remembered listening and trying to remain awake.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>She had been sleeping heavily for two hours when Eddie
Carter, alias E. Stuart Graydon, tried the bolt with the blade
of a kitchen knife. He had contrived, also, to fashion
another instrument out of a steel fork. Neither of these
worked.</p>

<p>As half-past five struck in the living-room, where he was
seated, he concluded that the other plan had become inevitable.
He had hoped it might be avoided. But the girl he
now had to deal with was no longer the ignorant, impressionable
child he had so easily moulded to his fancy.</p>

<p>There were two matters which preoccupied this man:
the first, a genuine passion for the girl-wife he had been
forced to abandon. Whatever this sentiment was,&mdash;love
or a lesser impulse,&mdash;it had been born the moment he lost
her; and it had painfully persisted through those prison
months.</p>

<p>The second matter which absorbed him was hatred for
the man who had sent him to a second term in prison. The
charge was forgery; the firm of Smull, Shill &amp; Co. procured
his arrest.</p>

<p>On these two matters his mind had remained fixed until
the poignancy of brooding became intolerable; and he
sought relief in prison-smuggled drugs. Which, so far,
was the history of Eddie Carter, addict, and penman par
excellence.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Now, hunched up in an arm-chair in her living-room, he
studied the immediate problem of Eris, picking eternally at
the upholstery with scarred fingers, or at his clothing, his
face, his own finger-nails&mdash;the skin around the base of the
nails raw from long habit of self-mutilation.</p>

<p>His first plan of enlisting the girl&#8217;s sympathy had proven
hopeless. There remained the alternate plan.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>Six o&#8217;clock sounded from the mantel-clock. He got up
and went to the pantry, where was a telephone extension for
servants. With some difficulty and delay he got the person
he was calling:</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, Abe, it&#8217;s Eddie. I&#8217;ve done what you said for me
to do&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t tell you to do anything!&#8221; interrupted his lawyer,
angrily. &#8220;Get next to yourself or I quit right now! D&#8217;you
get that, you cheap dumbbell?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure! But listen, Abe. I&#8217;m <i>here</i>. I&#8217;ve been here
since ten o&#8217;clock last night. We&#8217;re <i>both</i> here, Abe&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it fixed up?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Abe; and I want you to come right now. You
understand, Abe&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cut out the Abe every other word,&#8221; interrupted the
attorney wrathfully. &#8220;What are you trying to do to me?
Act like you got sense or I&#8217;m through!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right. Take it on the run. I&#8217;ll let you in. You
better not stop to shave; it&#8217;s six, now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be around,&#8221; replied the lawyer briefly.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>He came in a taxi-cab. Eddie Carter saw him from the
front window, went downstairs in his stocking-feet, and let
him in.</p>

<p>Climbing the stairs again they came into the living-room
without exchanging a word; but here Carter pointed to the
closed door of Eris&#8217; bed-room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Asleep?&#8221; inquired the other, still breathing hard from
the ascent.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. She&#8217;s locked in.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lawyer looked at him: &#8220;So she locked you out?
When?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Last night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t she make up?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;ll have to fix it&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>There was a silence; then the short, fat attorney took hold
of Carter&#8217;s arm and spoke close to his ear:</p>

<p>&#8220;Get this right! When she unlocks that door to come
out, <i>you came out with her</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You saw me,&#8221; nodded Carter.</p>

<p>They began to prowl around the apartment. In the
kitchen the lawyer whispered: &#8220;She must have some kind
of a maid that comes by the day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, a nigger. Her name&#8217;s Hattie. You going to buy
her, Abe?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t have to. She&#8217;s our witness anyway,&#8221; added
the little fat attorney, with a hint of a grin.</p>

<p>At that moment a key rattled in the kitchen door.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap2">AS Eris was entirely alone in the apartment at night, it
had been her custom to lock and bolt her chamber
door,&mdash;a rough neighbourhood and rear fire-escapes making
it advisable.</p>

<p>So now, when the rapping on her bed-room door aroused
her, she rose mechanically, still drugged with sleep, made
her way blindly to the door, and unlocked it.</p>

<p>As she opened her door so that Hattie could enter and
draw her morning bath, the sight of the coloured woman&#8217;s
agitated features startled her.</p>

<p>Suddenly a glimpse of Graydon in the living-room beyond
brought the girl to her shocked senses.</p>

<p>There seemed to be another man there, too&mdash;a fat, bald,
bland little man who smiled and bowed to her, flourished a
straw hat, clapped it on his shiny head, and immediately
waddled out of the apartment.</p>

<p>For one dreadful moment a premonition of disaster paralysed
the girl, blanched her face.</p>

<p>Then she walked straight into the living-room where her
husband slouched against the mantel, his hands in his pockets,
an unlighted cigarette sagging over his chin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get out of this house!&#8221; she said in a low voice that
quivered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Send that wench of yours to the kitchen,&#8221; he retorted
coolly.</p>

<p>Suddenly something about this man frightened her. It
was a vague, formless fear. But it was fear. She felt the
chill of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you leave this house?&#8221; she managed to say.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>&#8220;You listen to me first.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again a swift, indefinite fear silenced her. Danger was
written all over this man. What menaced her she did not
know, had no vaguest guess. But never before had she
looked into eyes so perilous.</p>

<p>When she found her voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;You may start breakfast, Hattie,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Start some for me, too,&#8221; added Graydon, without removing
his gaze from Eris.</p>

<p>And, when the lingering servant had gone, reluctant,
perplexed, still loitering in the dining-room devoured by
curiosity, Graydon said quietly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Eris, I want you back! That&#8217;s what&#8217;s the matter.
Take me back. You won&#8217;t be sorry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who was that man who came here?&#8221; she demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;He needn&#8217;t matter&mdash;if you&#8217;ll give me a chance to make
good&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want you to tell me who that man was!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Answer <i>me</i>! Will you take me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No! Now, who was he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My lawyer,&#8221; he said, &#8220;&mdash;if that interests you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you telephone for him, or was it already arranged?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;ll listen to me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Answer me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I called him up.... I hope I shan&#8217;t need him&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you threatening me with scandal because I let you
sleep here last night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no scandal&mdash;as long as you <i>are</i> my wife&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How long,&#8221; said she, &#8220;do you suppose I shall remain
married to an ex-convict?&#8221;</p>

<p>Graydon laughed, fished in his soiled vest for a match,
lighted his cigarette:</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve condoned whatever I&#8217;ve done, Eris,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve no case. You&#8217;ve condoned my offence. I guess
you&#8217;ll have to remain married to me, Eris.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>For a full minute she failed to understand, watching him
intently, searching for the sinister import of his words.</p>

<p>Suddenly her face flushed scarlet. The hideous thing
confronted her.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; he said coolly, &#8220;you can&#8217;t afford to face a
jury, now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You have two witnesses. Also, <i>you</i>
have nothing to lose, have you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I have.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;You!... I have <i>you</i> to lose. And I&#8217;m going to make
the play of my life for you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>His hideous features altered and a rush of startling
colour painted his cheek-bones with two feverish smears:</p>

<p>&#8220;You listen to me, now, and hold your tongue! I know
what you&#8217;re up to!&#8221; he said in a voice that broke with
passion. &#8220;I&#8217;ve trailed you; I&#8217;ve followed you; I&#8217;ve kept
tabs on you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When you&#8217;re not playing up to young Annan you&#8217;re
vamping Albert Smull. Yes, you are! Don&#8217;t stall! You
go to his fancy apartment alone. You go to Annan&#8217;s house.
You&#8217;ve got &#8217;em both on your string. You&#8217;ve got others.
Any man who meets you falls for you!&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He flung his chewed, wet cigarette into the fireplace; he
was trembling all over.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may think it&#8217;s because you&#8217;re making a wad of
money that I&#8217;m trying to get you back! That&#8217;s all right,
too; I&#8217;m glad you are on easy street. I need money, but not
much.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s <i>you</i> I want. And whatever you say or think, I <i>was</i>
in love with you when I married you. I <i>had</i> to beat it. It
drove me almost crazy to leave you. Two years in prison
drove me crazier. I&#8217;ve been sick. I&#8217;m sick now. I&#8217;ll get
well if you take me back.... And if you won&#8217;t&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He
came closer, looking intently into her eyes: &#8220;If you <i>won&#8217;t</i>&mdash;well,
there&#8217;s <i>one</i> man who isn&#8217;t ever going to get you,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
Eris.... And his name&#8217;s Albert Smull.... And the
next time I find him loafing around you, you&#8217;d better kiss
him good-bye. For, by Jesus, I&#8217;ll fix him good!&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl seated herself on the arm of a chair. Her head
was reeling a little, but she kept it high.</p>

<p>&#8220;How much money do you want?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I need that, too. I&#8217;ll take twenty-five dollars if you can
spare it. And I&#8217;d like a cheque with it. You&#8217;re making
good money: I guess five hundred won&#8217;t crimp you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her silk reticule still lay on the sofa where she had flung
it the night before. She picked it up, took from it the
money he required, and handed it to him.</p>

<p>Her cheque-book was in her desk. Seating herself she
opened it and wrote out the amount he had demanded, blotted
the strip of yellow paper, gave it to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I&#8217;ve paid you to keep away from me
until I free myself. After that the police can take care of
you if you annoy me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He smiled: &#8220;When you consult your attorney you&#8217;ll
realise that you have no witnesses and no case, little lady.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I need only one witness,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Any&mdash;physician.&#8221; Suddenly her white fury was
loosened and she took him by his ragged arm and shook him
till he stumbled and almost fell.</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you this,&#8221; she said, her grey eyes blazing, &#8220;because
you had better understand it in time to save yourself from
another term in prison! For if you ever dare contest the
action I shall bring with the vile lie you threaten, any witness
I call will send you back to a cell,&mdash;and your attorney
with you! And that&#8217;s <i>that</i>, damn you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Her hand fell away from his sleeve. He stood motionless,
sickly white as though something vital in him had been
shattered.</p>

<p>For, as he stared at her, he never doubted that she had
spoken the truth. And the truth meant his finish.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>As he stood there, stricken dumb, his bony frame was
shaking slightly and sweat chilled his face. He groped for
control of what mind his drugs had spared him,&mdash;strove to
clear it of chaos, formulate some thought, some charge of
misconduct against her&mdash;something to involve her with
some man. And knew, somehow, that it would be useless.
The girl had not lied. Any witness she chose to call meant
her vindication.</p>

<p>After a long while he passed his scarred fingers over his
face, wiping the sweat from his eyes. Then he turned,
slouched toward the door, opened it. And, on the sill,
slowly faced around and looked back at her.</p>

<p>&#8220;You win, Eris,&#8221; he mumbled. &#8220;I guess you&#8217;re good....
Stay so, and I won&#8217;t bother you.... But I won&#8217;t
stand for any other man.... Don&#8217;t make any mistake
there.... I mean Albert Smull. I know him. I know
how he gets women. You think you stop him but he&#8217;ll fool
you every time.... He&#8217;s a rat.... You keep away
from him.... That&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went, shambling, dull eyed, ghastly, picking at his
face with long, scarred fingers.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap2">AS the door closed behind Graydon, Hattie appeared
from the dining-room and sullenly confronted her
mistress.</p>

<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t a-going to stay,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>Eris looked up, blankly, still pale and confused by the
gust of passion that had swept her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t have to work in no such kinda place,&#8221; continued
the coloured woman doggedly, &#8220;and I ain&#8217;t a-going to.
Mah week&#8217;s up Friday, but you pay me up to las&#8217; night an&#8217;
I&#8217;ll go now.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl comprehended. A painful colour surged over
her face to the roots of her hair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; she said in a low voice. She went to her
desk, opened an account book, then drew a cheque for the
balance of the woman&#8217;s wages.</p>

<p>Hattie took the cheque, hesitated: &#8220;Of co&#8217;se,&#8221; she ventured,
&#8220;if yo&#8217; wishes me to stay, Miss Eris, mah wages will
be jess ten dollahs mo&#8217; a week. Any real lady would be
glad to gimme that foh all I does&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t need you,&#8221; said the girl quietly. &#8220;Go as soon as
you can get ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Suit yo&#8217;se&#8217;f, Mrs. Graydon,&#8221; retorted Hattie, with elaborate
disrespect, &#8220;and if I may kindly persume to be excused,
Mrs. Graydon, I will attend to the requiahments
necessary fo&#8217; my departure.&#8221;</p>

<p>Said Eris: &#8220;Pack your effects, Hattie, and call an expressman.
I shall not expect to find you loitering here
when I return.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>The coloured woman&#8217;s eyes snapped as Eris entered her
bed-room and closed the door.</p>

<p>To bathe and dress did not take her very long.</p>

<p>When she came out she was dressed for the street. There
was no breakfast on the dining-room table, but she wanted
none.</p>

<p>She went to the kitchen and found Hattie seated, feeding
on hambone, and her rickety valise still unpacked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want you to be out of this apartment by noon,&#8221; said
Eris quietly. Then she opened the hall door and ran downstairs,
Hattie&#8217;s malignant laugh ringing in her ears.</p>

<p>When Eris had disappeared, the negress waddled to the
gas stove, lit it, and started to make herself a cup of tea.
She meant to do what gastronomic damage she could short
of theft.</p>

<p>Before the kettle boiled, the telephone rang. To ignore
it was a haughty pleasure for Hattie; but presently African
curiosity prevailed and she got up and waddled to the telephone,
muttering to herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yaas, suh?&#8221; she replied to some query.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Who?</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mistuh Annan?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, suh, she ain&#8217;t home. Dey&#8217;s nobody home &#8217;cept&#8217;n
myse&#8217;f.&#8221;</p>

<p>Annan said: &#8220;I&#8217;ve some flowers. I&#8217;d like to arrange
them to surprise Miss Odell. Could I bring them around,
Hattie?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Suit yo&#8217;se&#8217;f, suh. It ain&#8217;t botherin&#8217; me none.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be right around,&#8221; he said gaily.</p>

<p>She went sullenly back to her kettle, meditating mischief.</p>

<p>Annan arrived in a few moments, laden with long, flat
boxes of pasteboard. He nodded pleasantly to Hattie, took
his flowers to the living-room, returned to fetch a dozen
plain glass vases, jars and rose-bowls, and went happily
back to the business of decoration.</p>

<p>He remained very busy for half an hour or more, filling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
the vases at her bath-tub, clipping stems, trimming too profuse
foliage, arranging the sheaves of fragrant bloom, and
carrying each vase to its proper place in the three rooms.</p>

<p>When he had finished, and on his way out, he stopped to
speak to Hattie at the dining-room door:</p>

<p>&#8220;Please ask Miss Odell to call me up when she returns,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;I suppose she has gone to the studio,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, suh. Miss Eris&#8217; husband he stayed here
las&#8217; night. I reckon she&#8217;s payin&#8217; him a call, maybe.&#8221;</p>

<p>Annan stared at her as though she suddenly had gone
mad.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yaas, suh,&#8221; continued the negress, &#8220;I&#8217;se quit, I has.
Too many doin&#8217;s in this here flat to suit me. I guess you
all didn&#8217;t know Miss Eris had a husband sleepin&#8217; here,&#8221; she
added with a bland malignance that stunned him.</p>

<p>He inspected the wench in silence for a moment, then
turned sharply on his heel and went down stairs.</p>

<p>His taxi was waiting. He drove directly home, entered
his study and sat down to the sorry business of waiting.</p>

<p>All the morning and afternoon he waited there, his face
white and set, his grim gaze fixed on space.</p>

<p>About five o&#8217;clock he called up. The house did not
answer.</p>

<p>Eris had asked him not to call her at the studio for
obvious reasons, and he never had done so, except by previous
agreement. But now he decided to do so. He got
the doorman, Flynn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir; Miss Odell come in half an hour ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is the company working?&#8221; inquired Annan nervously.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir, nobody&#8217;s here to-day except Miss Odell and Mr.
Smull&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Who?</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Smull, sir. He just come in a minute since&mdash;&mdash;Hold
the wire, please.&#8221;</p>

<p>After a minute or two the door-keeper&#8217;s voice: &#8220;She&#8217;s
busy, sir. She can&#8217;t talk to you now&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>&#8220;Did Miss Odell tell you to say that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Mr. Smull told me she couldn&#8217;t talk to nobody just
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Call up Mr. Smull again and tell him Mr. Annan wishes
to speak to Miss Odell at once!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like to&mdash;all right, hold it again&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Annan waited. Suddenly Smull&#8217;s voice: &#8220;Annan?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sorry, but the little lady can&#8217;t be interrupted just
now&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, she can. She isn&#8217;t working. Tell her to come to
the wire!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a business conference&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you kindly say to her that I wish to speak to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sorry,&#8221; interrupted Smull, and hung up in his ear.</p>

<p>Annan picked up his hat, descended the stairs, and went
out.</p>

<p>About five minutes after he left the house his telephone
rang. Mrs. Sniffen answered it, and recognised the voice
of Eris inquiring for Annan.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll see if he&#8217;s in, Miss&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did he call me a few minutes ago, Mrs. Sniffen?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t say, Miss; I was in the kitchen. I&#8217;ll see if
he&#8217;s in his study&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She returned in a moment to say that Mr. Annan was
not in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; came the girl&#8217;s hasty voice.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Eris hung up the receiver of the telephone in the directors&#8217;
office at the studio, where Smull stood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now will you believe me?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard you ask if it were Mr. Annan,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I
could hear perfectly well from my dressing-room.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought Flynn said it was Annan and I asked,&#8221; insisted
Smull, &#8220;but it turned out to be a <i>Herald</i> man who
wanted copy. So now if you&#8217;ll listen to me, Eris&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>&#8220;I have already tried to make you understand that I have
no interest in anything you say&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For God&#8217;s sake, be charitable and overlook what a man
says and does when he&#8217;s drunk&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you were&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was, I tell you! I carry it that way. I turn ugly.
When I get a few highballs in me I&#8217;m a different kind of
man.... Look here, Eris, if you&#8217;ll be a sport and call it
off, I&#8217;ll give you my word, as long as you and I are friends,
never to touch a drop of anything!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you would let me alone,&#8221; she said in a colourless
voice. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how you knew I was here&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I told Flynn to notify me as soon as you arrived&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was insolent of you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good heavens, Eris, I couldn&#8217;t let things stand as they
were, could I? The memory of my beastly behaviour to
you was driving me crazy. Anyhow, you&#8217;ve a cheque
coming to you and I had to get at the books&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is Mr. Creevy&#8217;s business.... I didn&#8217;t come here
for that, either. I came to gather up my personal belongings&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen, Eris. After all, I&#8217;ve given you your chance,
haven&#8217;t I? I&#8217;ve backed you with real money. Except for
that one break last night I&#8217;ve played square, haven&#8217;t I? All
right. Are you going to quit me cold?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re going to put this outfit on the bum? You&#8217;re
going to walk out on us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You told me I was out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you forget what a souse says when he&#8217;s all to the
bad? What&#8217;ll we do if you leave us flat? Do you think
it&#8217;s a cinch to pick another like you? What&#8217;ll this bunch
do? What&#8217;ll Creevy do, and Shunk? Look at this plant!
I&#8217;ve got it for a year more. Do you know what our overhead
costs me a week? Listen, Eris; have a heart. Don&#8217;t
do that to us&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>&#8220;It&#8217;s what <i>you&#8217;ve</i> done, Mr. Smull, not I. You&#8217;ve
spoiled any pleasure I might have had in working for you.
I couldn&#8217;t go on here. I couldn&#8217;t do good work. When
you told me, last evening, that I was out, you were right. I
was out as soon as you said so. It was final.... Truth
always is final.... I learned it last night.... There is
nothing further to learn.&#8221;</p>

<p>She walked slowly past him to the door and looked out
across the great, barn-like place all littered with the lumber
and canvas of half-demolished sets, tangles of insulated
wires and cables, and sprawling batteries of lights of every
sort.</p>

<p>In the heated stillness of the place a light footfall echoed
sonorously across the flooring. The chatter of intruding
sparrows came from the arches overhead. Outside sunny
windows ailanthus trees, intensely green, spread motionless
fronds under the July sky.</p>

<p>Eris moved on, slowly, to her dressing-room&mdash;a built-in
affair with its flimsy partition adjoining the directors&#8217; office.</p>

<p>Chintz and paint had mitigated the bareness of the room
with its extemporised dressing table and couch and a chair
or two.</p>

<p>For a while she was occupied with her make-up box;
then, locking it, she opened her suitcase and began to lay
away such articles as belonged to her.</p>

<p>As she locked and strapped it, Smull appeared at her
door, and she rose in displeasure, although the infraction of
rule meant nothing to her now.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your cheque,&#8221; he said, extending it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, I don&#8217;t want it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It belongs to you.... You could hold me for the
balance of the year if you chose, and not do a stroke of
work.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her short upper lip curled shorter in contempt:</p>

<p>&#8220;I release you, Mr. Smull.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want you to take this, anyway&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, Eris&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>No!</i>&#8221; She picked up her suitcase and make-up box.
But he continued to block the doorway.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eris! Eris!&#8221; he stammered. &#8220;Don&#8217;t do this&mdash;don&#8217;t
leave me! My God, my God!&mdash;I&mdash;can&#8217;t stand such&mdash;such
cruelty&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; His face was heavily flushed and his fat
neck was swelling red behind the ears.</p>

<p>He began to tremble and stammer again&mdash;&#8220;I&#8217;ll do anything
you ask&mdash;give you anything&mdash;if you&#8217;ll only listen&mdash;Eris&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eris&mdash;my God, I want to marry you! I want you! I&#8217;ll
keep away until I can get a divorce&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He caught her arm in his hot, red hands; suddenly
clutched her body, crushing her face against his with an
inarticulate cry as though strangling. And she fought him
back, savagely, in silence, bruised, wild with the shame of it.
Both chairs fell; he trod on one, crushing it to splinters, and
his powerful shoulder tore the mirror from the wall and
wrecked the dressing table with it.</p>

<p>With a desperate wrench she tore free of him. They
stood, panting, watching each other for a full minute.
Then her grey eyes dilated with horror, for he slowly took a
pistol from his pocket, his near-set black eyes, all bloodshot,
fastened on her.</p>

<p>&#8220;You listen to me,&#8221; he said brokenly, his great chest
heaving with every word,&mdash;&#8220;I want you because I can&#8217;t live
without you.... Will you marry me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll blow my brains out in your
face.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a terrible silence. Then he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;If you leave this room I&#8217;ll kill myself.... It&#8217;s up to
you, now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Another silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, why don&#8217;t you go?&#8221; he said.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>&#8220;I&mdash;am going.&#8221; She picked up the suitcase and make-up
box. Watching him, she began to move slowly toward the
door&mdash;passed him where he was standing, slowly, never
taking her eyes off him.</p>

<p>She reached the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;I swear I will do it!&#8221; he shouted.</p>

<p>She looked at him coolly over her shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are too fond of yourself,&#8221; she said. And walked on.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIX</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap2">AT the head of the stairway Eris, carrying her suitcase
and make-up box, encountered Flynn, the voluble
door-keeper, coming upstairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Odell,&#8221; he began, half way up, &#8220;the same gentleman
that tillyphoned you is downstairs askin&#8217; for you with
a taxi-cab. I wouldn&#8217;t leave him come up after what the
Governor told me. &#8216;No, sir,&#8217; says I, &#8216;ye can&#8217;t see Miss
Odell. I have me orders,&#8217; says I, &#8216;and I&#8217;m door watch
here,&#8217; says I, &#8216;and whin the Governor says to me, &#8220;Flynn,
do this; Flynn, do that,&#8221; be gob it&#8217;s meself that does ut!&#8217;
Was I right, Miss Odell?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t see any newspaper man now,&#8221; she assented,
nervously.</p>

<p>&#8220;So I told Mr. Annan, Miss,&#8221; commented the door-keeper,
relieving her of her baggage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Was it <i>he</i> who telephoned? I&mdash;I understood it was a
<i>Herald</i> man&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She continued on down the stairs, followed volubly by
Flynn. Outside the barred gate she saw Annan standing
beside a taxi-cab. Flynn opened the wicket. She went
out.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know it was you,&#8221; she said. &#8220;They misinformed
me. I&#8217;m so sorry.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl looked white and tired. One shoulder of her
frail summer gown was torn to the elbow and there were
red bruises on the skin already turning darker.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the matter?&#8221; he demanded bluntly, retaining
the nervous hand she had offered and touching her torn
sleeve with the other.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>She noticed the damage, then, for the first time; the hot
colour swept her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;An accident,&#8221; she murmured. &#8220;The place is impassable&mdash;a
jungle of lumber and knocked-down sets.... Will
you please drive me home, Barry?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is Mr. Smull?&#8221;</p>

<p>She lifted her gaze to the man beside her, then calmly
turned to Flynn and bade him place her luggage in the taxi.
Something in Annan&#8217;s eyes had alarmed her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is Smull here?&#8221; he repeated.</p>

<p>She did not answer.</p>

<p>An instant vision of Smull&#8217;s heavy black pistol and
a swift intuition that Smull was capable of using it on
anybody except himself,&mdash;these thoughts paralysed her
tongue.</p>

<p>She looked dumbly at Annan. The stillness of his drawn
face terrified her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Barry, come with me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait a moment,&#8221; he said, but she caught his hands desperately.</p>

<p>&#8220;Help me,&#8221; she whispered, &#8220;I need you. I tell you I
need you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to help you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Barry! You will destroy me!&#8221;</p>

<p>She meant that he would destroy himself, but intuition
shaped her speech.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want you to take me home,&#8221; she said.... &#8220;It is the
first thing I ever asked of you. Will you do it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Could you wait till I&mdash;speak&mdash;to Smull?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. Take me <i>now</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>He hesitated. She had clasped his arm. Her weight on
it was heavy; her face had grown deadly pale. He looked
at her closely; looked down at her torn sleeve.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is&mdash;is it anything that <i>he</i> did?&#8221; he demanded harshly.</p>

<p>She put out one hand blindly, reaching for the cab door;
wrenched it open; sagged heavily on his arm. He almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
lifted her into the vehicle; and she crumpled up in the
corner, her eyes closing.</p>

<p>Annan spoke to the driver, cast a quick, grim look at the
gate, then turned and jumped into the cab.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; he said, drawing her head to his shoulder, &#8220;we
won&#8217;t talk until we get home. If you feel faint we can
stop at a chemist&#8217;s. Lie quietly, dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>She lay against his shoulder, perfectly inert&mdash;so still
that, at moments, he leaned over to see her face, fearing she
had fainted.</p>

<p>Neither uttered a word. His thoughts had made glimmering
slits of his eyes and had set the hard muscles working
around his jaws.</p>

<p>But all the girl thought of was to get him away from
that heavy black pistol and from the man whose neck had
swollen red behind the ears.</p>

<p>For suddenly in that moment when she had seen that
terrifying expression on Annan&#8217;s face, a new and vital
truth had flashed clear as crystal in her brain. She saw it;
saw through it; knew it for Truth.</p>

<p>With her, Truth was always final. It settled everything
for her in whom no tiniest seed of self-deception ever had
germinated.</p>

<p>And Eris knew now that whatever became of her career,
this man beside her, who was her lover, was something
more, too. He was a care. He was a responsibility. He
was something to be defended; something to be guided.</p>

<p>For in that instant of fear in his behalf her whole being
responded with passionate solicitude.</p>

<p>Now she was beginning to comprehend that this solicitude
for him must always be hers while life endured; that
the overwhelming instinct to defend, protect, guide the man
who must always be a boy for her, dominated all else; and
would always rule her every thought and motive; her every
plan, every action.</p>

<p>She was beginning to understand that she must have her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
way with him as a mother with her son; that, to do so, she
must contrive, scheme, prepare, foresee, and above all, love.</p>

<p>And, above everything, even love,&mdash;if truly in her life
this man had become the passion paramount&mdash;she must be
prepared to give. And supreme, even above love and above
giving, she must give up!</p>

<p>She lay unstirring on his shoulder, her lids drooping,
thinking, understanding, searching, accepting.</p>

<p>It had happened. It was true. Chiefest of all in life,
and suddenly, and in the twinkling of an eye, had become
the passionate necessity for the happiness and well-being of
this man.</p>

<p>And she knew that she would give her life without a
second&#8217;s hesitation to protect his. And she knew that in
her heart, her mind, her soul, he came first. And all that
even most remotely pertained to him. And then, only,
came herself. Which was her career. The career, hardly
begun, to which she had dedicated all the best in her of
belief and effort. The career which, germinating, had
filled her ardent heart of a child, which had budded in girlhood,
and was in earliest blossom, now. The career for
which she had so gratefully gone shabby, had starved, had
slept under the stars in public parks.</p>

<p>Lying there on his breast she felt it slipping away&mdash;slipping
through her slender fingers on his breast. And if, for
an instant, her small fingers clutched at what was slipping
through them, it was his coat she grasped. And held,
tightly, knowing now what truly was her goal and what
above all else she must hold her whole life through.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&#8220;Dear,&#8221; he said gently, &#8220;we are here. Do you feel
strong enough to stand, or shall I carry you?&#8221;</p>

<p>If her smile were faintly wise it also was tenderly ironical.
God knew&mdash;and had whispered to her&mdash;who it was
between these two who would do the carrying; and who it
would be who was carried by the stronger.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>&#8220;Darling,&#8221; she murmured, &#8220;you&#8217;re so funny. I only
needed a nap because I didn&#8217;t sleep last night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you really been asleep, Eris?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I had visions, anyhow. Please pay this frightfully
expensive taxi and carry up my luggage, because
Hattie has left and I&#8217;m going to cook our dinner.&#8221;</p>

<p>They climbed the bare and poorly lighted stairs. Eris
fumbled for her keys, selected the right one, and opened the
door. The whole place was sweet with the scent of flowers.</p>

<p>As always, the girl&#8217;s gratitude was out of all proportion
for anything offered her; and now, in the living-room, she
stood enchanted, gazing at the flowers, touching them here
and there with finger tip and lip.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she murmured, &#8220;you are so sweet to me, Barry....
And you must have brought them and arranged them
while I was out.&#8221; She turned, happily, and took both his
hands. And saw the darkness of impending trouble in his
clouded face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Darling?&#8221; she exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nothing, Eris.... That miserable wench of yours
lied about you.... I suppose I&#8217;d better tell you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did she say, dear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&mdash;I can&#8217;t!&mdash;and it was a damned lie&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps it wasn&#8217;t. Tell me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m ashamed to.... She said a man was here&mdash;all
night&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she said disdainfully, &#8220;that was my husband. He
pretended to be ill and starving and I let him in. When he
got inside he tried to bully me. So I locked my door; and
in the morning I turned him out.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the girl&#8217;s healthy and flushed contempt, making of a
sinister situation only a squalid commonplace, the boy&#8217;s
formless fears&mdash;all the tragic perplexity faded, burned out
in a wholesome rage.</p>

<p>But into her grey eyes came the swift shadow of anxiety
again and she took hold of him, impulsively, by both elbows.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>&#8220;What am I going to do with you!&#8221; she cried in tender
exasperation. &#8220;Will you smooth out that scowl and mind
your business, darling? I can manage my own affairs.
I&#8217;ve never been afraid of anything&mdash;except to-day. My
only fear in the world is that you&#8217;ll get into mischief&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, do you think I&#8217;m going to sit still and let&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you mind your adorable business, Barry? You
worry me. You&#8217;re on my mind. I&#8217;ve got to marry you as
soon as I can I realise <i>that</i>&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He caught her in his clasp, fiercely.</p>

<p>&#8220;You <i>will</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You promise?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good heavens, yes!&#8221; she looked up at him, laughing.</p>

<p>Suddenly her eyes filled. She tore his arms away and
took him to her breast in a fiercer, closer clasp. Then the
long tension broke with her cry:</p>

<p>&#8220;Barry&mdash;Barry,&#8221; she breathed brokenly, &#8220;you belong to
me&mdash;you&#8217;re <i>my</i> boy! You&#8217;re all I ever owned in all my life
that really belonged to me.... I&mdash;I had a&mdash;a heifer&#8221;&mdash;she
was laughing hysterically&mdash;&#8220;but I had to sell her&mdash;and
<i>they</i> kept the money....&#8221;</p>

<p>She clung to him, strained him to her in an abandon of
long-pent need, incoherent between convulsive tears and the
sobbing laughter that shook her slender body:</p>

<p>&#8220;You want me, you need me, don&#8217;t you, Barry? You&#8217;re
lonely. No boy ever should be lonely. It is the wickedest
thing in the world&mdash;that any child should ever be lonely
for need of love.... You <i>are</i> a child! Mine! You&#8217;re
all I care about.... And I&#8217;m going to marry you because
you want me to&mdash;because we both want to&mdash;Barry, my
darling&mdash;my boy who belongs to me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXX</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">BEFORE she could inherit this boy who had willed himself
to her, Eris had to do everything for herself and
she knew it.</p>

<p>For a day or two she abandoned herself utterly to Annan.
Night alone separated them. Early morning saw them
united.</p>

<p>The hot, sunny July days they spent in the surf at Long
Beach, or in motoring through Westchester. Evenings
they dined together on some cool roof, or by the sea, and
returned to whisper happy intimacies together until long
into the morning hours.</p>

<p>Every lovely self-revelation of this girl more utterly
turned the boy&#8217;s head. Desire became absolute necessity.
Necessity became dependence. He did not understand that.
He supposed the dependence was hers&mdash;that, in the turbulent
torrent of Life he was the rock to which she
clung.</p>

<p>It was well that he thought that. It was well that she let
him think so. It always is best for a man.</p>

<p>Once, during those heavenly days, he met Coltfoot walking
with Rosalind Shore on Fifth Avenue.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought Eris would break with Albert Smull,&#8221; drawled
Rosalind. &#8220;What a sketch he is!&mdash;schmoozing about and
telling everybody he had to let her go! Betsy&#8217;s got him
buffaloed. He&#8217;s afraid of her parents; that&#8217;s all that holds
Albert.... I get banged around a lot, but Mom&#8217;s a pretty
good policewoman, and God help the Johnny with fancy
intentions towards her little Rosie.&#8221; She looked at Coltfoot,
standing beside her, with faintest malice.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>Coltfoot&#8217;s sophisticated retort was a bored smile. But
it was to Annan he spoke, asking him how his work was
going.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you care how my story is going?&#8221; said Annan,
laughing. &#8220;You&#8217;re an enemy to realism, and that&#8217;s all I
write.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Realism! You don&#8217;t know what it means,&#8221; said Coltfoot
bluntly. &#8220;What you write isn&#8217;t realism. If you want
realism, study your pretty friend Eris! She&#8217;s real. Everything
about her is genuine. Study her story. That&#8217;s
realism. Not as <i>you</i> once wrote it,&#8221; he added disgustedly,
&#8220;but devoid of ugliness and tragedy and sob-stuff. <i>She</i>
doesn&#8217;t whimper. She doesn&#8217;t know how to pose. The
<i>beau geste</i> and the attitude mean nothing to her. Sob-stuff
is wasted on her. Health never snivels. Do you get that,
Barry? <i>Health!</i> That&#8217;s the key. And by the Eternal, it
is the usual, not the unusual that is wholesome. The great
majority are healthy. That&#8217;s realism. And when health
is your keynote you have beauty, too. And <i>that</i> is Realism,
my clever friend!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I real because I am beautiful, Mike?&#8221; drawled
Rosalind, &#8220;or beautiful because I am real?&#8221;</p>

<p>So these three parted with the light jest of Rosalind
floating between them in the sunshine.</p>

<p>But Annan went on, a trifle out of countenance, to keep
a rendezvous with Eris at the Ritz.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At luncheon he said abruptly: &#8220;The stuff I do, Eris&mdash;you
know I&#8217;d like your opinion&mdash;I mean while I&#8217;m doing it....
Or rather, I&#8217;d like to talk over the story with you, first,
before I begin it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl looked up over her peach-ice. Her eyes were
very clear and still.</p>

<p>&#8220;What I want,&#8221; he explained, &#8220;is a perfectly fresh eye&mdash;a
fresh mind and a&mdash;a bystander&#8217;s point of view.... Not
that I don&#8217;t most deeply respect you as an artist&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>&#8220;It would make me very happy,&#8221; she said, &#8220;to have your
confidence in such things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I have a lot of confidence in your judgment. I&#8217;d
like to consult you.... Perhaps&mdash;I don&#8217;t know&mdash;no man
does know when his nose is too close to his work&mdash;but I&#8217;m
rather afraid I&#8217;ve been getting away from things&mdash;facts&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Her eyes grew tenderly humorous: &#8220;Whatever you get
away from, Barry, you can&#8217;t ever get away from me. I&#8217;m
the Nemesis called in to chasten you and clip those irresponsible
wings.... I know a little about wings. I used
to dream of them. Do you remember I once told you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About your flight. And how you found the god of
Wisdom seated all alone on the peak of Parnassus dissecting
a human heart?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So you remember.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; and I remember that little play you wrote in school&mdash;the
story of the wish, the wings, and the new hat.&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed, but there was the slightest shadow over the
grey eyes. The shadow which renunciation casts, perhaps.</p>

<p>&#8220;I took a longer flight than to Olympus,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and
it was you I discovered above the clouds;&mdash;all by yourself,
Barry,&mdash;on a funny little world, spinning up there&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was I busy dissecting somebody&#8217;s heart?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mine&mdash;I guess.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll tell you one thing, sweetheart; you never shall
regret marrying me. Never shall I by look or word or
deed interfere with your career. If I do, chuck me!&#8221;</p>

<p>She smiled&mdash;that tender, intelligent smile which lately
was one of her charming revelations that vaguely surprised
him. For the gods were granting her a little time yet&mdash;a
little respite for a career the limit of which already was
visible to her.</p>

<p>He had told her, diffidently, that he was not obliged to live
economically; that what he had was hers, also; that there
always was sufficient to finance any arrangement she wished
to make for her own productions.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>But the girl who had returned a hundred dollars to him
when she had only twenty more in all the world was no
more capable of accepting such an offer than of requesting
it.</p>

<p>Besides, no sooner had it been rumored that Eris Odell
and Albert Smull no longer co&ouml;perated, than telegrams
began to pour in from all sorts of people, responsible and
irresponsible. Offers arrived from keen, clever, capable
and ruthless producers, with releases guaranteed, and who
wished to fetter her for years at the lowest figure; from
enthusiastic people new in the game, with capital guaranteed
but no release. Scores of communications came from
various birds of prey who infest the fringes of the profession&mdash;the
&#8220;don&#8217;t-do-anything-till-you-hear-from-me&#8221; boys;
the noisy, persistent Gentile who lies for a living and whose
only asset is the people he traps; the Jew, penniless and discredited,
determined to make a commission out of anybody
and undeterred by the dirt of the transaction.</p>

<p>All of these communications Eris laid before Frank
Donnell.</p>

<p>Theirs was a close and sober friendship,&mdash;sombre even,
at times&mdash;because Frank Donnell had been in love with her
since her first awkward step in the Betsy Blythe company.
The girl knew it; both knew, also, that the matter was hopeless.</p>

<p>And for Frank Donnell, Eris was conscious of a gravely
tender affection she never had felt for anybody else in her
brief life.</p>

<p>He had saved enough money to finance one picture for
her; and he could have secured guarantees from the best of
the releasing companies on his own name alone. But,
again, it was one of those things that Eris could not do. It
was desirable; it was legitimate business. But to use the
resources of any man to whom she had given any intimate
fragment of herself was not possible for Eris.</p>

<p>And, although Frank Donnell never had said one word of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
love to the girl; and she always had ignored a fact that from
the beginning had been touchingly plain to her; there never
could be any speculative combination between them. It
was her way.</p>

<p>But, following his advice, an arrangement had been made
possible for one year between her and a great producing
company. And of this proposed contract she informed
Annan.</p>

<p>Together they consulted Annan&#8217;s attorney, Judge Wilmer;
and the first steps, in her suit for annulment of that
unconsummated farce of marriage, were taken.</p>

<p>Eris had not thought of going away that summer, although
her contract did not call her to report for duty until
October.</p>

<p>But early in August she began to feel a desire to be alone
for a while&mdash;a need for solitude,&mdash;leisure for self-examination.</p>

<p>Lately, too, she had thought much of her home. Not
that she missed the people who inhabited it. There never
had been any tie between her and her father.</p>

<p>But the girl cherished no resentment toward him. And
toward Mazie all her instincts always had been friendly.</p>

<p>Often she had thought of Whitewater Farms, not regretting,
not even missing the home where she had been born,
unwelcomed.</p>

<p>Yet, in these last weeks, a desire to go home for a while
had developed, and had slowly increased to a point where
she coupled it with her increasing necessity for quiet and
rest.</p>

<p>The girl was tired&mdash;saddened a little, perhaps. That is
the aftermath of all effort, the reaction from all attainment,
the shadow that dogs knowledge. And it is the white
shadow cast by Happiness.</p>

<p>There were other things, too, which directed her thoughts
unconsciously toward the only home she ever had known.</p>

<p>Eddie Carter had been annoying her again. She never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
spoke to Annan about it. But her husband was always
writing to her, now. Every few days brought begging
letters, maudlin appeals, veiled threats concerning Albert
Smull&#8217;s supposed attentions to her,&mdash;maundering, wandering,
incoherent epistles born of the drugs he used, perhaps.</p>

<p>And this was not all. Little Leopold Shill, Smull&#8217;s
partner, wrote to her in behalf of Smull, begging her to
pardon his unpardonable offences, expressing concern over
Smull&#8217;s desperate state of mind, begging her to be generous
and merciful to a man whose flagrant conduct had been due
to love alone&mdash;to a mighty and overwhelming passion which
bewildered him and made him really irresponsible.</p>

<p>To Leopold Shill&#8217;s two letters she made no reply. And
Shill did not write again. But Smull did. He had been
writing to her twice a day. She never replied. After the
first letter she destroyed the others without opening them.</p>

<p>But the annoyance was telling on her.</p>

<p>Sometimes, from her window, she saw Smull&#8217;s limousine
pass and repass her door, and the man&#8217;s red face at the
window peering up at her house.</p>

<p>At times the car stood for hours on Greenwich Avenue,
where its occupant commanded a view of Jane Street.</p>

<p>More than once, on the street, Smull had accosted her,
even followed on behind her.</p>

<p>Lately, too, it became apparent to the girl that her husband
also had been watching and spying on her, because he
wrote a violent, crazy letter insisting that she warn Smull
to keep his car out of her neighbourhood:</p>

<p>&#8220;&mdash;I&#8217;ve been keeping tabs on you,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;Now, I&#8217;ll
keep an eye on that&#8221;&mdash;unprintable epithets followed, nauseating
Eris; and she burned the letter without reading the
remainder.</p>

<p>One evening in early August Albert Smull, standing
beside his car on Greenwich Avenue and waiting for Eris to
leave her house, noticed a shabby individual apparently
watching him from the opposite corner.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>On a similar occasion, a day or two later, he noticed the
same shabby man on the same corner, staring steadily across
the street at him.</p>

<p>After a few recurrent glances, a vague idea came into
Smull&#8217;s brain that the shabby man&#8217;s features were familiar
to him.</p>

<p>Ordinary cowardice was not Smull&#8217;s kind. He walked
leisurely across the street and came up to the shabby man
and coolly scrutinised him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, by God,&#8221; he said calmly, &#8220;I <i>thought</i> I&#8217;d seen you
before. I heard you were out of prison. What&#8217;s your
graft now, Eddie?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Yours</i>,&#8221; replied Carter.</p>

<p>Smull, puzzled, awaited further explanation. Carter,
twitching all over, stood digging at the bleeding roots of his
finger nails.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; inquired Smull with his close-eyed, sanguine
smile, &#8220;what do you suppose is <i>my</i> graft, Eddie?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My wife, Eris Carter.&#8221;</p>

<p>Smull&#8217;s features turned a heavy crimson. After a
silence:</p>

<p>&#8220;So <i>that&#8217;s</i> the situation,&#8221; he said heavily.</p>

<p>Carter ceased twitching. He said very distinctly:
&#8220;When you and Shill sent me up the River, that&#8217;s what you
did to me, too.... On the day I was married to her, that&#8217;s
what you did to me. You made a crook out of me because
you didn&#8217;t pay me living wages when I worked for you.
Then you made a jail-bird out of me. Now, you&#8217;ve made
me a bum.</p>

<p>&#8220;And that isn&#8217;t enough for you. You want to make a
prostitute out of my wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shut your filthy mouth,&#8221; said Smull coolly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll stop your filthy mouth if you don&#8217;t keep away from
my wife,&#8221; said Carter in a still, uncanny voice.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>Smull laughed. &#8220;Beat it,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>And, as Carter did not stir: &#8220;Get a move on, you dirty
bum. Come on!... Or shall I have to hunt up a cop to
give you the bum&#8217;s rush?&#8221;</p>

<p>Carter&#8217;s visage turned ghastly:</p>

<p>&#8220;All right; I&#8217;ll go.... But you&#8217;ll go farther yet if you
don&#8217;t let my wife alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>He took one step toward Smull, hesitated, then, twitching
all over, he turned and shuffled away down Greenwich
Avenue, digging his thumbnails into his mangled fingers.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXI</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">ERIS went home early in August.</p>

<p>One fine afternoon, a week later, lonely as a dog that
has lost its master, and, like a lost dog, finding all things perplexing
in the absence of the Beloved, Annan, wandering
along, chanced to pass one of the great Broadway picture-theatres;
and noticed Betsy Blythe and Rosalind Shore
standing in the lobby.</p>

<p>They always welcomed him with affection. They did so
now. Betsy fairly bubbled energy, radiant in the warm
sun-rays of success, impatient for further triumphs, excited,
gossipy, cordial, voluble.</p>

<p>&#8220;I told Albert Smull I wouldn&#8217;t renew my contract unless
Frank Donnell went with it,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And I&#8217;ve nailed
Frank for five more years, Barry,&mdash;and my camera-man,
too. That is the only way to handle people&mdash;tell them
exactly where they get off. And off they&#8217;ll get every
time!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like,&#8221; remarked Rosalind lazily, &#8220;to see anybody
handle Mom that way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are <i>you</i> going to do next season?&#8221; inquired Annan
without much curiosity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sing a little song in a punk little play, for that&#8217;s where
I belong and that&#8217;s my little lay.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s got a sure fire comedy,&#8221; added Betsy, &#8220;and she&#8217;s
the whole show. She wears practically nothing, by the
way. But it&#8217;s horribly expensive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where does it get me?&#8221; drawled Rosalind. &#8220;I&#8217;m fed
up. <i>I</i> don&#8217;t want to work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you want to do?&#8221; inquired Annan, amused.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>&#8220;You&#8217;d be surprised.... I&#8217;d like to get married and
quit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Betsy knows. I&#8217;ll tell you, too, ducky. I&#8217;d like to
marry Mike.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221; he demanded, astonished.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mike Coltfoot, ducky. He makes a living. And I
make Mom&#8217;s. There&#8217;s the hitch. Mom would have my
life. And Mike would draw a corpse.&#8221;</p>

<p>Annan took her by both hands: &#8220;Bless your nice little
heart,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I never dreamed that you and Mike cared
for each other.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how <i>he</i> feels; I only know how he says he
feels,&#8221; she said cynically. &#8220;But, oh God, the fireworks if
Mom gets next! Do you wonder I&#8217;m fed up with work?&#8221;</p>

<p>Betsy said: &#8220;I tell her that if she feels that way about
her profession she&#8217;d better walk out on her mother and
marry Mike. I follow what I love. Every person ought
to.... By the way, what has become of Eris, Barry?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She has gone home for a rest,&#8221; he said carelessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where? Back to the pigs and cows?&#8221;</p>

<p>He reddened. &#8220;She&#8217;s gone to her home at Whitewater
Farms.&#8221;</p>

<p>After he had departed, Betsy looked at Rosalind; her
rosy mouth made a small oval.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did I do to <i>him</i>?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s spiked,&#8221; nodded the latter. &#8220;I&#8217;m spiked myself,
but if ever you see me as solemn about it as Barry is, why,
kick my shins, dear, and accept gratitude in advance.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she turned to shake hands with Coltfoot, who came
sauntering up, hat in hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, old top,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You&#8217;re half an hour late,
but I&#8217;d wait a lifetime for anybody who resembles you.
Come on in and see Betsy cut up on the scr-r-r-een!&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Since the departure of Eris, Annan&#8217;s appetite had become
an increasing source of worry to Mrs. Sniffen.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>That evening he left most of his dinner untouched.
When he had been writing all day he often did that. But
he had done no writing for days.</p>

<p>To Mrs. Sniffen&#8217;s fears and remonstrances he turned a
deaf ear, denying that he was not perfectly well.</p>

<p>&#8220;When does the last mail arrive?&#8221; he asked. He asked
her this every evening, now, and she always instructed him,
but he seemed to forget.</p>

<p>He went upstairs to his study, dropped onto the lounge,
lighted a pipe. What else was he to do&mdash;with the main-spring
broken.</p>

<p>He didn&#8217;t want to work. He didn&#8217;t intend to do any
more writing, anyway, without the close co&ouml;peration of
Eris. Something, evidently, was the matter with his work
and he was certain that she was capable of telling him what
it was. He knew that he was going to take a new view of
things in general, but he wanted her to point it out. He
wanted to start right; and be kept on the track for a while
until accustomed.</p>

<p>That, insensibly, he had become dependent upon the mind
of another person, did not occur to him. At least not
definitely.</p>

<p>He realised that the world meant Eris, and that without
Eris he had no other interest in the world, now.</p>

<p>And, to this man who never before had evinced any
interest in the world except as it concerned himself, it did
not seem odd that every vital principle in him now surged
around and enveloped this girl. The girl he had found
asleep in a public park.</p>

<p>Wherever he went, whatever he was doing, his mind
was on her. Not selfishly; although a deep instinct was
always telling him that whatever real work he ever was to
do would come through her.</p>

<p>Nor did he seem to think it odd that his personal ambition
now remained in abeyance. Fluency, too, seemed to have
departed: nimble mind and facile pen, the careless arrogance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
of youth and power, the almost effortless ability, flippant
juggling with phrase and word, and the gay contempt for
the emotion with which his audience responded when he
tossed up the letters of the alphabet and let them fall into
words&mdash;all these seem to have died.</p>

<p>Without analysing it he was feeling already the tension
of a new gravity in his character. It came, perhaps, from
the constant presence of an unknown god&mdash;the one that
always seemed to be waiting at the elbow of Eris&mdash;waiting
to be recognized before speaking. The god with a thousand
faces whose name is Truth.</p>

<p>He appeared to be on friendly terms with Eris. But
Annan had not yet become familiar with his faces.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXII</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">WHEN Eris decided to go home she gave her lover a
few hours&#8217; notice and went without further preliminaries
or fuss.</p>

<p>Annan met her in the station,&mdash;a very sober-faced young
man, solemn and sad.</p>

<p>It was she who offered the serious kiss of parting; she
who retained his hand, tender, reluctant, candidly concerned
as to his health and welfare if left for a while entirely self-responsible.</p>

<p>Neither saw any humour in the situation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please write me every evening, Barry,&#8221; she urged. &#8220;And
if you don&#8217;t sleep well, take a glass of hot milk when you
go to bed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, but how about you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll let you hear from me,&#8221; she nodded absently;
&#8220;&mdash;but I shall be rather anxious if you fail to write me every
evening. You won&#8217;t neglect to do it, will you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Finally he began to think her solicitude was mildly funny.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I had a mother,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that&#8217;s about what she&#8217;d say
to me. Who do you think is running this outfit, anyway,
Eris?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You, darling.&#8221;</p>

<p>His masculine smile made this obvious. And the solemn
directions he gave her about danger of catching cold in a
country house, about changing shoes and stockings when
she came indoors, and his warning concerning fried foods
and sudden change of drinking water were specimens of
psychological self-assertion which settled his real status.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>They kissed again as soberly as two children. She followed
her Red Cap through the gates, not looking back.</p>

<p>He turned again to a city desolate.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The journey proved tedious and hot. Her Pullman porter
brought her a paper-bag for her new straw hat. He brought
her a pillow, also; and luncheon later.</p>

<p>She had plenty of reading matter provided by Annan, but
it lay unopened on her lap; and Annan&#8217;s fruit, bon-bons,
and flowers lay on the floor at her feet.</p>

<p>All that sunny morning and early afternoon she lay listlessly
in her chair, watching the celebrated and deadly monotonous
river, content to rest, unstirring, unthinking, her
grey eyes partly closed, the water a running glimmer between
her fringing lashes.</p>

<p>At East Summit she changed to the local. She recognised
the conductor who took her ticket, but it was evident he did
not know her, and she was content to let it go that way.</p>

<p>Familiar farms sped into view, fled past, succeeded by remembered
hills and brooks and woods.</p>

<p>Reaping already was in progress on some farms. She
noted, mechanically, the cattle as she passed through a dairy
country. Mostly Holsteins. She saw a few Ayrshires
with their Noah&#8217;s Ark horns; a herd or two of Guernseys&mdash;not
to be compared to the Whitewater cattle as she remembered
them.</p>

<p>Summit Centre held the train until people finished getting
on and off, and the last crate of raspberries was aboard.</p>

<p>Summit and the great Sanitarium came next. It was here
she had seen her first picture-folk in action. A little tightening
of lip and heart&mdash;lest any atom of courage escape&mdash;then
the train moved on.</p>

<p>West Summit&mdash;a cross-roads, no more. And after a little
while, Whitewater.</p>

<p>She got out with her suitcase, her books, illustrated papers,
bon-bons, fruit, and flowers. A number of people looked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
twice at her to be certain before speaking. Men looked
oftener, shy of speaking.</p>

<p>She returned greetings smilingly, exchanged commonplaces
when necessary, aware but indifferent to the curiosity
visible in every face.</p>

<p>There was a new bus driver. She gave him the baggage-check,
got into the vehicle with hand luggage, flowers,
books, periodicals, bon-bons, and fruit.</p>

<p>Two commercial men bound for Whitewater Inn were
inclined to assiduous politeness. She remained scarcely
aware of them. She exchanged salutations with Gumbert,
the butcher, who got off at his shop. Otherwise, her fellow
travellers were unknown to her and unnoticed.</p>

<p>It was a mile to Whitewater Farms.</p>

<p>The country looked very lovely. It had rained that morning;
grass and foliage were fresh; gullies still ran water;
brooks gurgled bank high.</p>

<p>The sun, low in a cloudless sky, flung rosy rays across
green uplands and here and there a few acres of early
stubble. Trees cast long bluish shadows. Cattle were beginning
to wander toward the home-lane. It would be near
milking time at Whitewater Farms.</p>

<p>And now, leaning wide of her window in the clumsy bus,
she could see the gilded weather-cock a-glitter on the main
barn and swallows circling above brick chimneys.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At the front gate her trunk was dumped. She paid the
driver fifty cents; watched him drive away; then turned and
looked at the white house with green shutters, where she
had been born. It had been newly painted.</p>

<p>The world seemed very still there. She set her suitcase
beside her trunk, laid flowers, books, periodicals, fruit, bon-bons
on top of it, and walked slowly around the house to
the dairy.</p>

<p>One of her half-brothers, Cyrus, came out in his white,
sterilised milking jacket and trousers, chewing gum.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>&#8220;Well, f&#8217;r Gawd&#8217;s sake,&#8221; he said when the slow recognition
had been accomplished.</p>

<p>She offered her gloved hand and he took it with a plowman&#8217;s
clasp and wrung it, shifting from one leg to the
other&mdash;rural expression of cordiality&mdash;legs alone eloquent.</p>

<p>Commonplaces said, she made inquiries and learned that
everybody was well.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go right in, Eris! Pa&#8217;s getting into his milkin&#8217; duds;
Ma she&#8217;s cookin&#8217; supper. Go right in, Sis! I guess you
know the way&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; loud laughter and a large red hand
under her arm to pilot and encourage.</p>

<p>In the kitchen Mazie turned from the range, then set aside
a skillet, wiped both hands on her apron, and took Eris to
her ample bosom.</p>

<p>When she had kissed her stepdaughter sufficiently: &#8220;Pa!&#8221;
she called, &#8220;oh, Pa! Get your pants on and come down here
quick!&#8221;</p>

<p>Elmer was already on his way downstairs, clump, clump,
clump. He halted at the kitchen door, buttoning his snowy
jacket, gaping stolidly at Fanny&#8217;s child.</p>

<p>For he knew her instantly&mdash;Eris, daughter of Discord.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, Dad,&#8221; she said uncertainly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello.... Waal, waal, I&#8217;ll be jiggered! Waal, dang
it all!... So you took a notion to come back, did you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;ll let me stay for a little while&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Eris, how you talk!&#8221; exclaimed Mazie. &#8220;This is
your home; ain&#8217;t it, Pa?&#8221;</p>

<p>Elmer buttoned the last button of his milking jacket:</p>

<p>&#8220;She can stay if she&#8217;s a mind to. She allus does as she&#8217;s
a mind to,&#8221; he replied grimly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now you quit, Pa,&#8221; remonstrated Mazie, cheerily. &#8220;Eris,
you go right up to your own room. Everything&#8217;s just like
you left it. Where&#8217;s your trunk? All right; Si and Buddy
will take it up.&#8221; And to her husband: &#8220;Pa, I&#8217;m surprised
at you. Ain&#8217;t you a-going to shake hands with your own
daughter?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>&#8220;Gimme a chance,&#8221; he grunted.</p>

<p>He offered Fanny&#8217;s child a horny paw, gave her fingers
one pump-like jerk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Time you come home,&#8221; he observed. &#8220;I guess you want
your caaf money, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not if <i>you</i> need it,&#8221; she replied tranquilly. &#8220;Is the farm
doing well, Dad?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mazie said, laughingly: &#8220;He&#8217;s only foolin&#8217;. He&#8217;s making
more money than he can spend, Eris. You take your heifer-money
when you&#8217;re good and ready. It&#8217;s down to the bank
and all safe and snug.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eris smiled at them both: &#8220;Where&#8217;s that blue checked
gingham dress of mine?&#8221; she inquired. &#8220;If it&#8217;s clean I
want to milk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess you&#8217;ve kinda forgotten how,&#8221; drawled Elmer.
&#8220;You jest better set and rock and read into them novels you
allus liked&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to milk,&#8221; she repeated with a humorous glance
at Mazie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come right up to your room then, Eris. I&#8217;ll show you
where I put that gingham.&#8221; And, to Elmer: &#8220;You hush
your face, Pa. Eris can milk any cow she&#8217;s a mind to.
Come along, Eris&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But the girl lingered on the stairs: &#8220;What is the herd-bull&#8217;s
name, Dad?&#8221; she asked curiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;We got White Cloud now. Lemme see,&mdash;was it Whitewater
Chieftain when you was here&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.... I want to see the herd come in. I&#8217;ll hurry,
Dad&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She ran upstairs after Mazie.</p>

<p>Her father passed his huge hand over his face absently;
then, very deliberately, he scratched his grizzled head.</p>

<p>Si broke the silence: &#8220;She&#8217;s a hum-dinger, Pa. I&#8217;ll say
so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey?&#8221; grunted Elmer, scowling at his son.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t she?&#8221; insisted Cyrus.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>&#8220;Waal, I dunno. She dresses kinda tidy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She looks like she did when we all seen her on the
screen,&#8221; said Si. &#8220;I guess she&#8217;s made her pile. They all get
big wages in the movies. You gotta go to the city to make
big money&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;G&#8217;wan down to the barn,&#8221; said his father drily.</p>

<p>The first murmur of discord already: and Fanny&#8217;s child
scarcely arrived!</p>

<p>Elmer&#8217;s frowning face was lifted to the floor overhead&mdash;a
moment&mdash;then, heavily he followed his own and unmistakable
offspring down to the milking barn.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In her room the sight of objects long forgotten filled her
heart;&mdash;and the odour of the house, the particular odour of
her own room&mdash;melange of dyed curtains, cheap wall-paper,
ingrain carpet&mdash;a musty, haunting odour with a slight aroma
of fresh air filtered by forests.</p>

<p>Two of her half-brothers appeared with her luggage.</p>

<p>Buddy, grown fat and huge, shyly shook hands with her
and fled. Mazie kissed her again and retired, taking Si with
her, whose fascinated gaze had never stirred from the only
real actress he ever had beheld.</p>

<p>Eris seldom cried. But now she sat down on her bed&#8217;s
edge and buried her face in the pillows.</p>

<p>Tears flowed&mdash;tears of relaxation from strain, perhaps.
And perhaps the girl wept a little because she really had
nothing here to weep for&mdash;no deep ties to renew, no intimate
memories of tenderness.</p>

<p>Bathed, her bobbed hair hatless, and in gingham and
apron, Eris went downstairs and out across the grass.</p>

<p>Below, winding into the barn-yard, tonk-a-tonk, tonk-a-tonk,
came the Whitewater herd. Here and there a heifer
balked and frisked; now and then a cow lowed; and the
great herd-bull, White Cloud, set the barn vibrating with
his thunderous welcome to the returning herd.</p>

<p>Red sunshine poured through the lane, bronzing the silky<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
coats of moving cattle. Overhead, martins twittered and
dipped and circled. There was the scent of milk in the still
air&mdash;of clover, and of distant woods.</p>

<p>In the milking barn she encountered old Ed Lister. He
seemed to have grown much older, and there was a dim
bluish look to his eyes.</p>

<p>Eris shook hands with him.</p>

<p>&#8220;How-de-do,&#8221; he said, peering at her. And answered,
&#8220;Yes, marm,&#8221; and &#8220;No, marm,&#8221; as though in his mind
there was some slight confusion concerning her identity.</p>

<p>She passed along the stanchions, petting and caressing
the beautiful creatures, dropping handfuls of bran, tossing
in a little clover-hay.</p>

<p>Everywhere satin-smooth coats were being wiped off,
udders bathed in tepid water. The cattle were busy with
bran and hay or drinking from the patent buckets.</p>

<p>Eris went to the calf-pen, where fawn-like heifer-calves,
pretending shyness and alarm, soon came crowding to lick
her hands.</p>

<p>She looked at the bull-calves; at the two young bulls selected
to aspire to future leadership.</p>

<p>She went to the bull-pen, where the herd-bull, White
Cloud, gazed curiously upon her, sniffed her hand, stretched
his massive neck to be rubbed and fondled, rolling contented
and sentimental eyes.</p>

<p>Her half-brothers, Gene and Willis, came in wearing
spotless white. Greetings were friendly and awkward; and
presently they went on into the western wing to attend to
the cows on test there.</p>

<p>Her father and Cyrus were already milking. Buddy was
in the loft; Ed Lister sat with gnarled fingers clasped and
dim gaze fixed on the cattle, quiet, solemn, aged.</p>

<p>Eris walked slowly along, reading the names of the cows
affixed to each stall&mdash;Mazie of Whitewater Farms, Star-Dust,
White Gentian, Guelder-Rose of Whitewater, Snowberry
Lass, Moon-Queen, Apple-bloom&#8217;s Daughter&mdash;&mdash;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>She took milking stool and pail and seated herself by
Guelder-Rose, who became a trifle restive.</p>

<p>&#8220;So, lass!&mdash;soo&mdash;lass,&#8221; she murmured, stroking the white
and golden skin. And in a few moments the pail vibrated
with alternate streams of milk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Dad,&#8221; she said, &#8220;have I forgotten?&#8221;</p>

<p>Elmer grunted. Then, abruptly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Guelder-Rose is by Whitewater Chieftain outa Snow-Rose,
with a record of eleven thousan&#8217; six hunder&#8217;n&#8217; ten an&#8217;
two-tenth pound uv milk, an&#8217; five hunder&#8217;n&#8217; twenty-one,
forty-seven pound uv butter-fat in class G.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is a fine record, Dad,&#8221; said the girl cordially.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guesso. Yes. An&#8217; that there Moon-Queen; she&#8217;s got
a record uv eleven six fifty-four an&#8217; three-tenths and five
sixty-two, thirty-four. Herd sire, Chieftain; outa Silver
Frost&#8217;s daughter, Snow-Crystal of Whitewater&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Outa Lass o&#8217; the Mist,&#8221; croaked Ed Lister in uncompromising
correction.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right, Ed,&#8221; admitted Elmer.</p>

<p>For a time there was no sound save the hissing of milk
in the pails.</p>

<p>Eris carried her pail to the steelyards, weighed it, took the
pencil dangling by its string and filled in her memoranda
opposite the name of Guelder-Rose. Then she transferred
her attentions to Apple-bloom&#8217;s Daughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Made a lotta money, Eris?&#8221; inquired Elmer abruptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Waal, I guess you spent it, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey? Got it yet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Most of it, Dad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Waal, I&#8217;ll be jiggered.... What you aimin&#8217; to do with
it, Eris?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Save it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Any investments?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>&#8220;What d&#8217;ya buy? Wild-cats?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Liberty bonds.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gosh!&#8221;</p>

<p>Cyrus&#8217; voice from behind a cow: &#8220;You gotta go to the
city to make money.&#8221;</p>

<p>Elmer said: &#8220;You poor, dumb thing, they&#8217;d skin ya. You
ain&#8217;t got a gift like Eris. G&#8217;wan an&#8217; weigh your milk &#8217;n&#8217;
shut your face.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cyrus muttered for a while. Eris said: &#8220;There seems to
be too many people for the jobs in New York.... The
poor are everywhere.... I&#8217;ve seen them sleeping in the
grass in the public parks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ya hear that, Si?&#8221; demanded Elmer.</p>

<p>Unstirring, solemn, dim of eye, Ed Lister spoke: &#8220;I was
to York in &#8217;85. I seen things in my day.&#8221;</p>

<p>Elmer said to Eris: &#8220;Ed he worked in West Fourteenth
Street. He knows what, too, same&#8217;s you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was a-truckin&#8217; it fur Amos T. Brown &amp; Company,&#8221;
said the old man shrilly. &#8220;I was a hefty fella, I was. I
seen doin&#8217;s in my time, I did. But they hain&#8217;t nothin&#8217; into
it. You spend more&#8217;n you git down to York. Yes, marm.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cyrus sniffed derisively, unconvinced. Buddy, having
shaken down sufficient hay, came in with a sack of lime.</p>

<p>&#8220;You most done?&#8221; he inquired. &#8220;Supper&#8217;s ready, I
guess.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap2">ANNAN&#8217;S letters came to her every day. She answered
infrequently,&mdash;not oftener than once a week.</p>

<p>Other letters were forwarded from Jane Street,&mdash;persistent
letters from Smull begging to know where she had
gone,&mdash;abject letters betraying all the persistence of a man
who knows no pride, no shame in pursuit where there ever
had been an end to gain.</p>

<p>Eris read only the first of Smull&#8217;s letters. The others
went, unopened, into the kitchen range.</p>

<p>Twice, also, her husband wrote her,&mdash;evidently aware of
annulment proceedings,&mdash;vaguely threatening her in case
she married Smull,&mdash;furnishing her with a mass of filthy
detail concerning Smull&#8217;s private life, menacing her and him,
pleading,&mdash;sometimes begging for money.</p>

<p>She read both letters, sent them to her attorney, and
cleansed her mind of them and of the creature who had
written them.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The time was shortening; the days were drawing near
when she must report for work.... Her last year of
work, perhaps.... The last year, maybe, of her screen
career.</p>

<p>She wrote to the man who already had become the object
paramount of her life:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
&#8220;Dearest:&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p>&#8220;Your daily letters reassure me. You do me a great kindness
in writing them. Long ago, before I knew what love
was, your unvarying kindness won me. Always, to me, it
remains the most wonderful thing in the world.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>&#8220;We are not yet in full autumn here at Whitewater
Farms. Few leaves have turned. Except for miles of
golden-rod and purple asters on fallow and roadside, and
acres of golden stubble, and the wine-red acres of reaped
buckwheat, one would scarcely believe that summer had
ended in these Northern hills.</p>

<p>&#8220;I went to-day to Whitewater Brook, where I encountered
the first person connected with pictures I ever had seen. You
will laugh. It was poor old Quiss.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was fishing. He didn&#8217;t possess much skill. He called
me &#8216;sister&#8217; and &#8216;girlie.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I clung to him as a cat clings to a back fence. I pleaded,
I implored for his aid and advice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor old fellow, I always shall be grateful. I met Frank
Donnell through him&mdash;dearest of my friends excepting you,
Barry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, I walked along the brook and sentimentalised
in the dappled sunlight of the yellowing woods. The blue-jays
were like winged sapphires everywhere; squirrels made
a most prodigious noise among dry leaves. In a hemlock I
saw a large owl sitting.</p>

<p>&#8220;I took home a huge sheaf of asters. Even in my arms
butterflies hovered about the gold and blue blossoms.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&#8220;I shall leave here soon. My stepmother and my half-brothers
are kind to me. My father, too, in his own way.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I shall not come to Whitewater Farms again.</p>

<p>&#8220;In spite of kindness, I am not wanted. Finally, I have
come to understand that.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not really welcome; I am pleasantly endured. My
people have nothing in common with me. It always has been
so. I seem to have been born an outsider. I still am. They
can&#8217;t help it; nor can I. There seems to be no bond, no tie,
no natural obligation of blood, none of custom, to hold me
here.... It is a lonely feeling. But it has been mine from
earliest recollection.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>&#8220;Often I used to wonder why I had no intimate affection
for this house, for the place&mdash;trees, hills, woods.</p>

<p>&#8220;I love them&mdash;but as one who passes that way often, and
becomes fond of a neighbour&#8217;s house and trees.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never have they, in any intimate sense, been mine, or
part of me.... Not even my old dresses, my few books,
my fewer child&#8217;s toys, have I ever truly considered mine&mdash;lacking,
perhaps, the love that should have been the gift,&mdash;the
spirit, Barry&mdash;which left me only with the substance&mdash;a
lonely, lonely child.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gradually I have come to realise that, before I came
back, harmony reigned at Whitewater Farms. Now, there
is the slightest note of discord. I am conscious of it. I
know the others are. I understand, now, it was inevitable....
I am Eris, daughter of Discord.... But for you,
Eris and Eros are merged and one. I strike out the i!...
Forever, Barry. I and i melt into U and you! My eyes,
too. Darling! Did you ever suspect such silly wit in me?</p>

<p>&#8220;Your attorney writes to me occasionally. He assures
me he is speeding the annulment. To me, that brief phase
was vaguer than a dream of which one remembers only an
indefinable discomfort.</p>

<p>&#8220;When it is brushed away forever I shall marry you. If
children come I can&#8217;t go on acting&mdash;or only between times.
Not even then, because I shan&#8217;t leave them or you;&mdash;or you,
Barry&mdash;chiefly you.... I shall be a good wife and a good
mother.... And you shall provide our fame.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I shall turn lazy, and repose in the shadow of your
greatness.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&#8220;When our time has come I should like a small house in
the country. Would you? A garden? Hills&mdash;breezy in
spring&mdash;and a little brook in the woods&mdash;and a cow or two&mdash;for
the children&#8217;s sake. Do you mind, darling?</p>

<p>&#8220;When I was a young girl I was inclined toward verse.
Here is one effusion:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent">&#8216;This is my Prophet&#8217;s Paradise to come:&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">Long grass a-tremble by a little brook,</div>
<div class="verse">A hillside where brown bees contented hum,</div>
<div class="verse">And I alone there with God&#8217;s Wonder-book</div>
<div class="verse">Wherein I read and ponder, read and pray,</div>
<div class="verse">Learning a truer Truth from day to day.&#8217;</div>
</div></div>

<p>&#8220;Be merciful to a school-girl&#8217;s rhymes. I&#8217;ve still a book
full to show you, dear.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now, back to earth: I begin work in a little while,
as you know.... And I am very fain to have you take
me in your arms, Barry. And so shall soon come to you,
being inclined that way&mdash;yours&mdash;yours no less truly now
than when the law permits&mdash;always your property&mdash;your
refuge, God willing&mdash;your roof, your shelter, your retreat,
to hold by right, to enjoy in peace&mdash;the girl you found
shabby and asleep, and have awakened, clothed in light.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gratitude undying; loyalty to you; love.</p>

<p class="right">&#8220;Eris.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXIV</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">THAT mental jumping-off place, popularly known as
&#8220;the psychological moment,&#8221; is usually hatched out
of the dust-pan of Destiny. Materialistic sweepings. And,
sometimes spontaneous combustion follows.</p>

<p>Old Lady Destiny, house-cleaning, swept together, from
various directions, elements which, uncombined, would not
have set the dust-bin afire.</p>

<p>Apropos of Annan and his stories, Coltfoot had made this
objection, saying that the literary explosion never seemed
to be spontaneous, and charging the author with secreting
in the heap a firecracker of commercial manufacture.</p>

<p>Coltfoot, in the absence of Eris, began to frequent Annan.
A rudderless ship, a homeless pup, a gasless flivver&mdash;these
similes haunted him whenever he beheld the quenched features
of Barry Annan.</p>

<p>Annan had been candid with him. It was love, he admitted,
that knocked every other ambition out of him.</p>

<p>And, at first, Coltfoot thought so, although in his case
with Rosalind, love was proving a stimulus to effort amazing,
resembling inspiration.</p>

<p>But gradually a disturbing explanation for Annan&#8217;s idleness
forced itself upon Coltfoot. The boy&#8217;s motive power
seemed to be suspended.</p>

<p>Except for the personal pleasure Annan had taken in his
mental acrobatics, there never had been anything inspired
in his work until he began his latest novel&mdash;still merely
blocked in.</p>

<p>But this story had in it, carefully and skilfully laid, a
deep-bedded foundation of truth. And work on it began<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
from the day that Eris had promised to become his
wife.</p>

<p>Through all the upsetting excitement of the boy&#8217;s courtship,
the inception of the story had produced nothing material.</p>

<p>In the glow of glorious certainty it had flowered under
the girl&#8217;s tender ministry.</p>

<p>In her absence, now, all growth ceased.</p>

<p>It was a disturbing explanation that seemed to force itself
upon Coltfoot,&mdash;that, in Annan, there was nothing creative
except through the vitality of this girl. Or that the living
germ was in her; and that Annan was merely the medium
for transplantation&mdash;adequate soil skilfully mixed for culture
of seeds developed in the entity of Eris.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>He said one day to Annan: &#8220;How far in any creative
work Eris would go if she had the chance, I couldn&#8217;t
prophesy.... I saw some of the continuity of that last
Smull picture she made&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Annan looked up sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;&mdash;It is a noble piece of creative acting,&#8221; said Coltfoot
in a deliberate voice.</p>

<p>After a silence Annan said: &#8220;She shall have every chance
in the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The trouble is, with such a girl, that she is likely to lend
herself to her husband&#8217;s career.... And ignore her own....
There is in her a breadth of generosity I have seen
very seldom, Barry,&mdash;perhaps never before.... And she
is very much in love.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you suppose I&#8217;d accept any such sacrifice, Mike?&#8221;
demanded Annan impatiently.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may have no option. She is a curious girl. Enormously
capable. Perfectly normal. Intensely human....
She is the balanced type which civilisation is supposed to
breed. And seldom does. That is why the ordinary becomes
extraordinary; why symmetry is such a rarity....<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
We&#8217;re a twisted lot, Barry. We never notice it until we see
somebody who not only was born straight, but who has continued
to grow that way.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The elements of ignition began to collect in Destiny&#8217;s
dust-pan toward the end of the month.</p>

<p>Camille Armand, Gowns, 57th Street, sent Betsy Blythe
an estimate for her personal adornment in the proposed production
of a super-picture to be called <i>The Devil&#8217;s Own</i>.</p>

<p>Betsy sent the outrageous estimate to Frank Donnell.</p>

<p>Donnell sent it to Albert Smull.</p>

<p>His partner, Leopold Shill, got hold of it and objected
with both hands.</p>

<p>Smull telephoned to Donnell that he&#8217;d drop in and discuss
cuts in the morning.</p>

<p>A minor accident detained Donnell&#8217;s suburban train.</p>

<p>Smull arrived at Donnell&#8217;s office and sat down at Donnell&#8217;s
desk to wait.</p>

<p>Donnell&#8217;s secretary opened the director&#8217;s morning mail
and laid it on his desk under the ruddy nose of Albert Smull.
On top was a telegram to Donnell from Eris, dated from
Whitewater, N. Y. Smull read it:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;Arrive Saturday evening, Jane Street. Would love to
see you before I begin work. Do call me up after Monday.
Best wishes always.</p>

<p class="right">&#8220;Eris.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>Smull was standing by one of the windows looking out on
Broadway when Donnell arrived.</p>

<p>They discussed the estimate Betsy had submitted, came
to an economic conclusion, parted.</p>

<p>Smull went down-town. But he could not keep his mind
on business. He had a row with Shill, was brutal to a
stenographer, made enemies of one or two customers, bullied
his personal office force, and finally put on his hat and light
overcoat and departed, leaving everything in a mess.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>At the Patroon&#8217;s Club that afternoon he saw Annan passing,
and saluted him; and was ignored.</p>

<p>This didn&#8217;t suit him. He turned back, and, coming up
alongside of Annan:</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; he asked; &#8220;anything wrong,
Annan?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, <i>you</i> are,&#8221; said the boy.</p>

<p>Smull was still smiling his near-eyed smile, but his sanguine
features reddened more heavily.</p>

<p>They had walked as far as the Strangers&#8217; Room. There
was nobody there, not even a servant.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s all this about?&#8221; demanded Smull. &#8220;I don&#8217;t get
you, Annan&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t get anybody. That&#8217;s why your activities are
ridiculous and you obnoxious.&#8221;</p>

<p>Smull&#8217;s grin became mechanical: &#8220;Are you trying to
quarrel with me over a skirt who has made monkeys out of
both of us&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Annan hit him hard. He lost his balance, stumbled backward
and landed on a leather sofa, seated. His left eye was
already puffing up. He seemed too astonished to stir.</p>

<p>Annan went over to the door, locked it, leaving the key
there. Then he came back and waited for Smull to get up,
which he did after a moment, and began to remove his coat
and waistcoat.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll both be expelled,&#8221; he said coolly, &#8220;but it&#8217;s worth
it to me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>A heavy automatic pistol fell from an inside coat pocket
to the carpet.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I ought to use on you,&#8221; he remarked; but
he picked it up and dropped it into the side pocket of his
coat.</p>

<p>Then he turned and was on Annan like a panther. Both
fell, smashing a chair; both were on their feet the next second.
But Smull&#8217;s bolt was sped. His face was congested;
he was panting already. He had lived too well.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>Annan walked toward him, perfectly aware that he could
hit him when and where he chose.</p>

<p>But after he had selected the spot he couldn&#8217;t do it. In
fact, there was nothing further to do or say.</p>

<p>He looked into the crimson, disfigured visage, at the two
red and swollen fists awaiting attack.</p>

<p>Then, dropping his hands into his pockets, he turned on
his heel, walked slowly to the door, let himself out, closed
the door quietly behind him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Smull emerged a little later, stepped into the elevator, and
went up to the club barber.</p>

<p>&#8220;Charlie,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I got bunged playing squash. Kindly
apply the sinking fund process to my left eye.&#8221;</p>

<p>After an hour&#8217;s treatment: &#8220;I guess that&#8217;s the best I can
do, Mr. Smull,&#8221; concluded the barber.</p>

<p>Smull inspected himself in the glass: &#8220;Hell,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;&mdash;and I&#8217;ve got a date.&#8221;</p>

<p>However, he dined early at the club. He maintained
sleeping quarters there. Dinner was served in his room.
He had a quart of Burgundy to wash down the entr&eacute;e, and
one or two more serious highballs for the remainder of the
repast. He was a fastidious feeder, but always a large one.
It was that, principally, which played the devil with him.
A skin saturated with alcohol completed the muscular
atrophy of what had been a magnificent, natural strength in
college.</p>

<p>But that was long ago: his sensations had been his gods
too long. They had done for him&mdash;worse still, they had
nearly done <i>with</i> him. What remained, principally, was a
shameless persistence. Only the man himself knew the
tragedy of it. But such men are doomed to go on.</p>

<p>That is their hell.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>From the club Smull called up his limousine.</p>

<p>When the doorman announced it, Smull threw aside the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
evening paper, took a look at his damaged eye in a mirror,
put on hat and overcoat, and went out to where his car stood.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know where,&#8221; he said to his chauffeur, &#8220;&mdash;and stop
somewhere for the evening papers.&#8221;</p>

<p>A newsboy on 42d Street supplied the papers. Smull
continued to read all the way to Jane Street. But when his
car drew up along the east curb of Greenwich Avenue, he
laid aside the papers and settled back to watch.</p>

<p>Through the early October dusk, illuminated shop windows
and street arc-lights shed conflicting rays and shadows
over passers-by.</p>

<p>Smull&#8217;s vision, too, was impaired, and he squinted intently
at every taxi, watching for one that would turn into Jane
Street.</p>

<p>He could see the front of the house where Eris lived. He
could see, also, that her windows were unlighted. It was
evident that she had not yet arrived.</p>

<p>He hadn&#8217;t the least idea what time she would appear. She
had said nothing about that in her telegram to Frank Donnell.
Her telegram said &#8220;Saturday evening,&#8221; nothing more
precise. There was nothing for him to do except to wait.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And now the Old Lady, scraping away vigorously at the
four points of the compass, dislodged a bit of rubbish and
swept it into her dust-pan with all the rest.</p>

<p>The fragment in question came drifting through Greenwich
Avenue in the October night, half revealed in the glow
of some humble shop window, lost in the shadow beyond,
dimly visible along the dark fringe of an arc-light, fading to
a shade again,&mdash;a spectre now, and now a ghost-white face
adrift in the night.</p>

<p>At the corner of Jane Street the shape stood revealed,&mdash;a
shabby man, deathly pale, who stood as though he had
nowhere else to go&mdash;stood with lowered head as though preoccupied,
picking nervously at the raw skin around his
finger-nails.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>Chance and the Dust Pan dumped him there,&mdash;the chance
that his wife had returned to Jane Street. He had no knowledge
of her coming; did not know where she had been or
when she would return. All he knew was that there never
were any lights in her windows any more. He had written
to her, but she had not replied. And he needed money.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Smull&#8217;s chauffeur, reposing resignedly at the wheel,
straightened up abruptly, then left his seat and came around
to the open window of the car.</p>

<p>&#8220;That bum is over there on the corner again, Mr. Smull,&#8221;
he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s in the shadow of that doorway&mdash;just south of the
corner, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; nodded Smull.</p>

<p>He could now just distinguish a shape there. For some
time he watched it, speculating on the affair and still puzzled.
For how the girl who had so contemptuously repulsed him
could ever have married the derelict across the street, Smull
was unable to conjecture.</p>

<p>More perplexing to him still were her relations with
Annan. He did not wish to believe they were meretricious.
In the muddy depths of him he didn&#8217;t believe that. But he
would not have hesitated to accuse her.</p>

<p>Anyway, it didn&#8217;t matter. Annan didn&#8217;t matter, nor did
the bum across the way; nor did the girl&#8217;s intrigues, chaste
or otherwise, matter to this man.</p>

<p>He was after his quarry. Perhaps in the muddy depths
of him he knew the chase was hopeless. Perhaps he was
doomed to hunt anyway&mdash;never to rest, never to quit the
trail over which he had sped so eagerly, so long ago, after
his first quarry.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>He had smoked four large cigars and was lighting a fifth.
It was ten o&#8217;clock. No taxi had turned into Jane Street.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>The windows of the house he watched remained unlighted.
And, across the street, the shadowy shape had not stirred.
Undoubtedly the fellow had recognised Smull&#8217;s car. Which
concerned Smull not a whit.</p>

<p>However, he was growing restless. He had over-smoked,
too.</p>

<p>Now he flung away the cigar just lighted, opened the
limousine door and got out.</p>

<p>To his chauffeur he said: &#8220;That&#8217;s all. Call up at eight-thirty
to-morrow morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That bum is still over there, sir&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, Harvey. Go back to the garage.... And
I&#8217;ll want the coup&eacute; to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very good, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>Smull watched the car glide away down Greenwich Avenue,
turn east, disappear.</p>

<p>Then he walked across to Jane Street and as far as the
house he was watching, and gazed up at her darkened windows.</p>

<p>For half an hour or so he sauntered back and forth between
her house and the corner. The night had grown
warmer and he loosened his light grey overcoat and threw
it back.</p>

<p>Now and then he noticed that the shadowy shape of
Carter had not stirred. That did not concern him for a
while.</p>

<p>But, as the hour wore on, irritation increased and his
nerves became more susceptible to annoyance.</p>

<p>And once, although his contempt for Carter remained
supreme, he ran his right hand over the coat pocket where
the pistol sagged,&mdash;a movement involuntary and quite unconscious.</p>

<p>A little before eleven a taxi-cab suddenly turned out of
Greenwich Avenue and halted before the house in which
Eris dwelt.</p>

<p>Smull was prowling some distance to the westward on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
the opposite side of the street; and the sudden appearance
of the cab caught him unprepared.</p>

<p>He started back instantly; but even before he arrived opposite
the house she had entered it, carrying her suitcase.</p>

<p>Her taxi-cab, however, remained waiting.</p>

<p>Smull gazed up at her windows. Suddenly a light broke
out behind the lowered shades.</p>

<p>He looked across at the waiting taxi. He was going to
have another chance.</p>

<p>When the light went out behind the yellow shades it
would be time enough to cross the street. He thought so.
Meanwhile, he would wait. He&#8217;d take his time. What&#8217;s
time to a gentleman?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Eris had lighted the apartment, had taken one swiftly
comprehensive glance at the dusty solitude about her, then
she hurried to the telephone and gave Annan&#8217;s number. And
heard his voice, presently:</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Darling!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eris! Why on earth did you wire me and neglect to
tell me what train to meet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I didn&#8217;t know, dearest. Sometimes the Central
waits for the local and sometimes it doesn&#8217;t. I didn&#8217;t want
you to spend the evening hanging around the Grand Central&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You blessed child, I&#8217;ve done it. I&#8217;ve met every train.
They told me there were no more from Whitewater. So I
came home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Darling!</i> I&#8217;m fearfully sorry. They were quite right,
too. The Central did not wait for the local, so I took a
taxi at the station and drove thirty miles to catch an express&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where on earth are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Home&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m coming&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>&#8220;No! It&#8217;s dusty and messy and horrid. May I come to
Governor&#8217;s place? I have a taxi&mdash;and I&#8217;m starved&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jump into that taxi instantly! I&#8217;ll find Xantippe and
have something for you in a few minutes. Will you come
at once?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m on the way, Barry.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was on the way. But it was the feminine way.</p>

<p>First of all she had a toilet to make, a complete change of
clothing to effect. No girl ever lived who would deny herself
that much before she braved her lover.</p>

<p>She went to the windows to reassure herself that the
shades were properly lowered. Her taxi was both visible
and audible below. She noticed nothing else in the street
except that it was beginning to rain.</p>

<p>Probably she could not have recognised Smull, even
if she had caught sight of him on the opposite side of the
way.</p>

<p>There is an old brick building there, untenanted, its shabby
fa&ccedil;ade running westward toward the North River.</p>

<p>Against it Smull stood in darkness.</p>

<p>But already another person had discovered Smull; had
recognised him; and now was shuffling slowly along toward
him.</p>

<p>The last bit of rubbish in the Dust Pan.</p>

<p>Smull, intent on the lighted windows above, did not notice
The Rubbish until it had drifted close to his elbow. Then
he turned. It did not suit Smull to have any altercation then
or there.</p>

<p>He said in a guarded voice: &#8220;Get out of here, you son of
a slut!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to talk to you,&#8221; said Carter, hoarsely. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got
to have some money&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Smull, infinitely annoyed, turned his back and walked
westward, turning up the collar of his light overcoat as the
drizzle thickened from the River.</p>

<p>He walked a few paces, stood looking back over his left<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
shoulder at the windows where light shone behind the yellow
shades.</p>

<p>Presently he was aware of Carter close behind him. His
instinct was to kick him aside; but it was too near the house
he was watching and he wanted no outcry or scuffle.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you want, you dirty bum?&#8221; he demanded,
fumbling in his pocket, &#8220;&mdash;a dollar for a shell of coke?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want you to keep away from my wife,&#8221; said Carter in
a ghost of a voice.</p>

<p>Smull turned on him savagely. Neither stirred. But it
was too close to her house: and Smull, deciding to end the
matter quickly, turned once more and walked toward the
North River.</p>

<p>When he concluded that he was far enough away in the
obscurity he halted, listening for the shuffle of feet.</p>

<p>But Carter came very silently; he was at his elbow again
before he heard him. Then, for the first time, the stealthy
movements of the man seemed to convey a menace to Smull.</p>

<p>As he confronted Carter he began to unbutton his overcoat,
deliberately at first, then more swiftly as he saw the
expression in his enemy&#8217;s eyes.</p>

<p>White as a corpse, Carter said something to him he did
not understand as his hand closed on the pistol sagging in
his coat pocket.</p>

<p>Then he saw a pistol in Carter&#8217;s hand; felt a terrific blow
in the stomach that knocked him against the brick wall behind
him.</p>

<p>As he slid down to a sitting posture, all darkness seemed
crashing down around him. And through the rushing chaos
he freed his pistol and fired at a grey blur above him,&mdash;fired
again as sight failed in his dying eyes,&mdash;lay very still there
in the rain....</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Eris, aglow from her shower bath, began to realise it was
time to hurry.</p>

<p>In her clothes press she rummaged feverishly, selecting the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
freshest of last season&#8217;s dinner-gowns,&mdash;an orchid-mauve
affair with touches of violet and silver,&mdash;very charmingly
calculated to enhance her chestnut hair and slender, milk-white
beauty.</p>

<p>Now she really must hurry&mdash;for the mantel-clock had
run down weeks ago and her wrist-watch was broken, and
she had that deliciously guilty feeling which is entirely and
constitutionally feminine&mdash;the sensation of being awaited
by love impatient and probably adorably out of temper.</p>

<p>To see whether it still was raining she ran to the window.
The street seemed to be full of movement and noise&mdash;shrill
voices, people running, a throng in the rain surging, ebbing,
scattering as an ambulance clanged into the street from
Greenwich Avenue.</p>

<p>A second&#8217;s hesitation, then she lowered the shade, ran to
her closet for a cloak and umbrella, opened the outer door,
switched off every light, and hurried downstairs.</p>

<p>On the steps she opened her umbrella and made her way
through the increasing crowd toward the taxi-cab.</p>

<p>She had no morbid curiosity concerning such painful
scenes, when curiosity alone could afford no aid. She heard
a ragged boy say something about &#8220;a coupla guys dead acrost
the street&#8221;&mdash;and shuddered as she stepped into the taxi-cab.</p>

<p>The driver turned around and opened the front window:</p>

<p>&#8220;When I heard that first shot,&#8221; he said excitedly, &#8220;I tuk
it f&#8217;r a blow-out. Yes, ma&#8217;am. Then come two more shots
an&#8217; I gets wise an&#8217; ducks. I hear them two fellas are dead.
Some gun-play. I&#8217;ll say so.... Where to, lady?&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXV</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">ONLY in books does the story of an individual begin and
end.</p>

<p>But birth cannot begin that story; nor can death end it.</p>

<p>Sequel and sequence, continued and continuous, serial interminable.</p>

<p>At the autopsy enough coal-tar was discovered in the
viscera of Mr. Carter to account for the large orifice he blew
in the abdomen of Mr. Smull.</p>

<p>The motive, too, seemed to be clear enough. Smull had
been instrumental in sending Carter to prison, where he had
become an addict.</p>

<p>Also, Mr. Shill exhibited letters in which Mr. Carter
promised to &#8220;get&#8221; Mr. Smull unless a satisfactory financial
arrangement were made for his personal maintenance.</p>

<p>The name of Eris did not appear in the newspapers.</p>

<p>There were black-edged cards tacked to the bulletin boards
of several fashionable clubs, announcing the decease of Albert
Wesly Smull. Nothing like that for Eddie Carter.</p>

<p>Saint Berold&#8217;s Chapel indorsed Smull. The music was
especially fine. The Crook&#8217;s Quickstep for Carter; Broadway&#8217;s
roar his requiem.</p>

<p>However, what was left of Eddie, coal-tar and all, went
to Evergreen Valley Cemetery in an automobile hearse,
chased by one trailer.</p>

<p>A young girl got out of the trailer after the coffin was
lowered, the grave filled, and the mound deftly shaped. She
laid a bunch of wild blue asters and golden-rod on the
mound.</p>

<p>Then, after she had stood motionless for a minute, she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>
got into the trailer again, where a young man awaited her.</p>

<p>Until their automobile was outside the cemetery neither
of them spoke.</p>

<p>Then: &#8220;I&#8217;ve been wondering,&#8221; said Annan, &#8220;what is your
religion, Eris,&mdash;what particular denomination.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I am quite happy in any church. Or,
in synagogue or mosque, I should feel no barrier between
my mind and God&#8217;s.... Would you?&#8221;</p>

<p>He could not say.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Annulment proceedings, not yet begun, never, of course,
were.</p>

<p>The status of Eris, its solution and dissolution, had been
effected by another solution. Coal-tar. Chemistry had sundered
the tie which, we are instructed, God alone manufactures.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When they arrived at No. 3 Governor&#8217;s Place, Eris went
into the guest-room, where, centuries ago, she had lain abed
under the roof of a man whose name even she did not know.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to lie down before dinner, Barry. May I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Can Mrs. Sniffen do anything for you?&#8221;</p>

<p>But the girl said no, and turned down the lace spread. So
Annan lowered the shades and went out to his study.</p>

<p>At dinner Eris appeared very much herself, smiling, gaily
inquisitive concerning Annan&#8217;s conduct during her recent
absence, tenderly diverted to hear how intolerable he had
found those few weeks without her. He became emphatic
in recollection of his solitary misery.</p>

<p>&#8220;Darling, we should not feel that way, ever,&#8221; she insisted.
&#8220;Absence should be a stimulus to carry on. Otherwise&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
she shrugged, stopped. But he knew she had meant death.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but I want to tell you that in that
event, I follow. And that&#8217;s <i>that</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>He even borrowed her phrase to fix, irrevocably, their
mutual positions. But without that the girl already knew,&mdash;deep,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>
deep within her she had long known,&mdash;where the spring
of their vital strength had its occult source. And more absolutely,
more perfectly the knowledge made this man hers.</p>

<p>Truly there was nothing else in the world for her; no
other rival she ever could brook that claimed the mind and
strength that she was giving to this man&mdash;and must always
give as long as mind and strength endured.</p>

<p>There still remained for the career of Eris an autumn, a
winter, and a spring in California.</p>

<p>Work was to begin very soon. This knowledge sobered
their leave-taking that night.</p>

<p>It tinged all their meetings and leave-takings, a little, during
that otherwise perfect week in town.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>She wore his betrothal ring when she went away.</p>

<p>Annan stood the separation for a month, then went after
her.</p>

<p>During the winter Annan went three times to the Coast.
Both, however, thought it best that he should not remain.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Eris made three pictures. Two were the species known
as feature pictures; the third a super-picture.</p>

<p>She was paid for her work five hundred dollars a week.
She was offered twice as much to sign for another year.
Then twice as much again.</p>

<p>To Annan she wrote:</p>

<p>&#8220;I had to tell them that circumstances beyond my control
might interfere. I meant children, darling, but did not consider
it necessary to be more definite.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As for Annan, excepting his brief journeys to the Coast,
he passed a miserable, apathetic, unreal winter.</p>

<p>To Coltfoot it was painfully plain where was the true and
only source of the boy&#8217;s inspiration.</p>

<p>Everything else now appeared to be only a sort of native
ability polished with usage to cleverness where technical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>
fluency and journalistic nimbleness in narrative did brilliant
duty for the real thing.</p>

<p>For a few days, after being with Eris, enough of her in
him lasted so that he could get on with his novel. Then he
needed her again. But he realised his necessity only when
he had gone on for a while without her.</p>

<p>Dark days came for the boy; incredulity, alarm, chagrin,
the struggle renewed, doubt, helplessness, and the subconscious
cry for her, never written nor voiced, yet, somehow
heard by her at the edge of the other ocean.</p>

<p>Always the occult appeal was answered; always she responded
in a passion of tenderness and abnegation&mdash;her
promise that the days of separation were drawing to their
end, that soon she would come to him forever.</p>

<p>She came when May was ending.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>He thought she seemed a trifle taller;&mdash;had never dreamed
she was as lovely a thing;&mdash;yet should have been prepared&mdash;for
always she had been a series of enchanting revelations.</p>

<p>It transpired that she still had a few days left of her
career&mdash;spots to fill in with &#8220;Eastern stuff,&#8221; where the continuity
called for it&mdash;a location here, a set or two to be
knocked together, nothing exacting.</p>

<p>Then the professional career of Eris was to be &#8220;irised
out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never!&#8221; repeated Annan, holding her so that he could
see deeply in her grey eyes. And saw a tiny image there,
reflected&mdash;the miniature of himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she murmured, &#8220;that event is with God, darling.
But I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s much doubt, because I love children....
And anyway&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She lifted her eyes to her lover, smiled, recognising her
destiny.</p>

<p>After dinner that evening, in his study, he sat at his desk
with the typed manuscript over which he had agonised all
winter.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>Eris, perched on the arm of his chair, read it over his
shoulder, page after page.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems to be getting on, darling,&#8221; she ventured.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve got to talk it over with you. I <i>want</i> it to be
the real thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll make it so.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked up at her. In his eyes there was a sort of
tragic curiosity. Her heart seemed to stand still for an
instant.</p>

<p>Suddenly he smiled, bent and touched his lips to her betrothal
ring.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;<i>Things unattempted yet in prose or rhyme</i>,&#8217;&#8221; he murmured.
&#8220;And these things are in <i>you</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>She bent her head close to his: &#8220;What do you mean by
&#8216;<i>things unattempted</i>&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Milton&#8217;s line, Eris, not mine.... &#8216;<i>Things unattempted.</i>&#8217;...
And latent in you.... Not within <i>me</i> ...
unless you give them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her grey eyes said: &#8220;If they truly are in me you have
only to take.&#8221; Her lips tenderly denied such possession,
attributing all origin to him.</p>

<p>The boy said: &#8220;God knows where it comes from; but it
is in me only when you are near.&#8221;</p>

<p>She rested her cool cheek against his. Her career was
paid for.</p>

<p>&#8220;One thing,&#8221; he said with an embarrassed grin, &#8220;is likely
to annoy you. But I&#8217;ve got to show it to you. You haven&#8217;t
seen to-day&#8217;s papers, have you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.... Oh, <i>Barry</i>!&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You bet, sweetheart. It&#8217;s the announcement of our engagement.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Darling! How wonderful! And what do you mean by
my being annoyed? I authorised you to announce it any
time in May it suited you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it,&#8221; he admitted. &#8220;<i>I</i> was to send the announcement
to the papers. But I didn&#8217;t know how such things<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>
were done so I was ass enough to go to my Aunt about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eris flushed. &#8220;Was Mrs. Grandcourt annoyed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you what happened. I knew she had just arrived
from Bermuda, and I went yesterday afternoon. Well&mdash;my
aunt is my aunt. We don&#8217;t get on.</p>

<p>&#8220;We went through our semi-yearly financial pow-wow.
That&#8217;s all fixed for the next six months.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then she gave me an opening by asking, suspiciously,
whether I knew where you were.... Did you know she
once warned me to keep away from you?&#8221;</p>

<p>The colour in Eris&#8217; face deepened: &#8220;No, I didn&#8217;t know
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The reason,&#8221; he said airily, &#8220;was because she liked and
respected you, and considered me a philanderer&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Barry!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I <i>was</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>There ensued a painful pause. Then their eyes met; and
he reddened and said in a low voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t anything to ask your pardon for&mdash;even mentally.&#8221;</p>

<p>They both were trembling a little when they kissed.</p>

<p>&#8220;&mdash;About my aunt,&#8221; he resumed, the faint grin again
apparent; &#8220;when she mentioned you I said, &#8216;Oh, by the way,
I&#8217;m marrying Eris in June. I meant to mention it&mdash;&mdash;&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dearest, the extraordinary face my aunt made at me
stopped me.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think she was too astounded to understand whether she
was pleased or not. You see she had got me all wrong,
dear. I wasn&#8217;t the sort she believed.</p>

<p>&#8220;One thing was rather extraordinary. Did you suppose
my aunt could swear? Well, she can. She swore at me for
ten minutes, threatening dire things if I philandered with the
granddaughter of Jeanne d&#8217;Espremont&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Barry!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, she did. And when finally it filtered through her
skull that I was semi-decent, she became very much excited....<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>
You&#8217;ve got to have a very grand church wedding, Eris.
Do you mind?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Darling! I&#8217;d adore it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, for heaven&#8217;s sake&mdash;Well, I&#8217;m glad you feel that
way. Men usually don&#8217;t, you know.... But it&#8217;s all
right&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Barry!&#8221; she said in ecstasy, clasping her white hands
as unconscious of dramatic effect as when she pleaded with
Mr. Quiss on Whitewater Brook.</p>

<p>He said: &#8220;My aunt&#8217;s a snob. Here&#8217;s the announcement
she sent out yesterday afternoon&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He opened a drawer, took out a dozen clippings. They
read them together:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Magnelius Grandcourt announces the engagement
of Eris Odell, granddaughter of the late Comtesse Jeanne
d&#8217;Espremont, of Bayou d&#8217;Espremont, Louisiana, to Barry
Annan, only son of the late Mr. and Mrs. Grandcourt Annan,
of New York.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Odell is the descendant of one of the oldest Royalist
families of France,&mdash;her great grandfather coming to this
country as a refugee during the Terror of &#8217;93. Miss Odell&#8217;s
grandmother, Comtesse Jeanne d&#8217;Espremont, and Mrs. Magnelius
Grandcourt shared the same room at boarding school
in Exmouth, Virginia.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Odell, who early in childhood evinced unusual artistic
proclivities, had chosen the silent drama as a medium
for self-expression, and is charmingly known to the artistically
fastidious section of the nation&#8217;s public.</p>

<p>&#8220;But after the wedding, which will occur in June, Miss
Odell has decided to retire from a career which promises
such brilliant fulfilment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Annan served his country in the Great War as
Liaison Officer and was decorated for gallantry in action.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is an author of repute and promise.&#8221;</p>


</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>After a silence: &#8220;<i>That&#8217;s</i> her work, Eris. I told you she&#8217;s
a snob.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl looked at him with a troubled smile: &#8220;It&#8217;s rather
too late to do anything except live up to what she says of
us&mdash;isn&#8217;t it, Barry?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You wonderful girl, you&#8217;ve already lived way beyond
anything that anybody says of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her arms went around his neck, tightened:</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Darling!</i>... But we must make good.... You know
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He knew it. He knew that she already had. He rested
his head on her breast like a tired boy.</p>

<p>It was up to him.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
